# Continuation: Brain Factory - Nate-Fueled Synthesis System

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Updated:** 2026-01-23 20:20 PST
**Status:** Active - Bulk capture COMPLETE, ready for Graphiti review

---

## Resume Prompt

```
Continue Brain Factory work. Session context:
- Architecture documented in MEMORY/brain-factory/
- TELOS models extracted (ADHD-LLM, Flow State, Bridge Between Troughs)
- Bulk capture COMPLETE: 118 emails in MEMORY/learning/nate-b-jones/email-captures/

Next: Graphiti engineering review
- Current: ChatGPT hits = expensive
- Proposal: Route through Haiku via Claude subscription
- Reference: continuations/GRAPHITI_TEMPORAL_KG.md
```

## What Got Done This Session

### Session 3: Bulk Capture (2026-01-23 evening)
1. **Diagnosed capture bug** - Tool searched `subject:Nate` (5 results) instead of body text
2. **Fixed gmail-fetch.ts** - Added CONFIG object with configurable search query
3. **Added pagination** - Now handles 100+ emails properly
4. **Ran bulk capture** - 116 new emails + 2 existing = 118 total
5. **Updated continuation** - Ready for Graphiti review

### Session 2: Architecture (2026-01-23 morning)
1. **Reviewed continuation** - Understood the _NATE skill state
2. **Mapped actual workflow** - Your flow state creativity pattern (2 weeks running)
3. **Named it Brain Factory** - Systematized creativity pipeline
4. **Created visual briefs** - HTML explainers in `MEMORY/brain-factory/briefs/2026-01-23/`
5. **Extracted TELOS insights** - 6 mental models captured from conversation:
   - MO0: ADHD-LLM Model
   - MO1: Flow State Chemistry Model
   - MO2: Stratified Adoption Model
   - MO3: Compelling Vision Bridge Model
   - MO4: Lossy Moments Model
   - MO5: Primer → Synthesis Model

## Key Insight Captured

> "Capturing and amplifying and reminding this thing is what you are running towards. The bridge between the troughs."

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. ✅ Foundation: Bulk Capture - COMPLETE
- 118 emails captured to `MEMORY/learning/nate-b-jones/email-captures/`
- Tool fixed with configurable query and pagination

### 2. Engineering Review: Graphiti + Haiku (NEXT)
- Current: ChatGPT hits = expensive
- Proposal: Route through Haiku via Claude subscription
- Need: LOE, risk, implementation path
- Reference: `continuations/GRAPHITI_TEMPORAL_KG.md`

### 3. Design: Automatic TELOS Extraction
The meta-problem: insights emerge during work, get lost.
Need a session-end or real-time extraction flow.

## The Vision

Build something that **demonstrates mastery**, on a project you'll **do anyway**, that gets you into **the conversation you want to be in**, while practicing **knowledge graphs at hobby scale**, and feeding the **Brain Factory** with better primers.

*Ready to continue. Run the bulk capture, then Graphiti review.*
