# Continuation: Renify DCM Marketing Project

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23 (Friday evening)
**Deadline:** ✅ COMPLETE - Content in Rick's doc
**Next Meeting:** Saturday with Rick

---

## Quick Start

```
Continue the Renify marketing project. Review Rick's feedback from Saturday meeting, refine messaging, develop NeonBrain parallel track.
```

---

## Context Summary

**What this is:** Marketing project for Renify's Distributed Coaching Model (DCM) - peer coaching mastermind for ADHD. Collaborating with Rick Webster while building parallel NeonBrain version.

**Strategic tension:** Rick wants $40 referral fees for therapists. Doug believes value should speak for itself + safety/standard-of-care matters more to therapists.

**Approach:** Follow Rick's lead, don't rock the boat, note disagreements in NeonBrain parallel track instead of arguing.

## Session Log (Jan 23)

**What happened:**
1. Reviewed Rick's marketing letter in the shared doc
2. Refactored v1 → v2 to complement Rick's language (not compete)
3. Adopted Rick's metaphors: Map/Vehicle, Implementation Lab, Scaffolding, Intention/Action Gap
4. Positioned our content as "DCM Clinical Detail Sheet" - the operational backing for Rick's pitch
5. Created HTML version for clean Google Docs paste
6. **Pushed to Rick's doc** ✅

**Key decision:** Our content is the "appendix" - clinical details careful therapists need AFTER Rick's pitch gets attention.

## Key Messaging (Updated)

**Rick's metaphors (adopted):**
- Map vs Vehicle (therapy = map, DCM = vehicle)
- Implementation Lab
- Scaffolding
- Intention/Action Gap
- Circle of Care
- Treading water

**Doug's additions (in shared doc):**
- Standard of care / boundaries clarity
- Trauma-informed protocol
- What we do / what we don't do
- Ready, Willing, Able framework
- Risk removal backing

**Core positioning:** DCM is the "implementation lab" that helps clients navigate the map therapists create.

---

## Doug's Preferences

- Safety/standard-of-care messaging matters
- Trauma-informed approach documentation matters
- Don't want $40 referral fee distraction
- Build both versions simultaneously
- Call out disagreements in NeonBrain track, not Rick's doc

---

## To Resume

1. Read `~/.claude/WORK/renify/` folder for context
2. Check Rick's doc for his feedback/edits
3. Debrief Saturday meeting
4. Continue NeonBrain parallel development
