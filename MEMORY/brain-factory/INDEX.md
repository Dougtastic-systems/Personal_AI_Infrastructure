# Brain Factory - Project Index

**Purpose:** Systematized creativity pipeline for multi-domain synthesis
**Started:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Active - Foundation phase

---

## What This Is

A system that:
1. **Pre-primes** with problem states (Hemingway bridges)
2. **Fuels** with pattern-rich content (Nate as primer)
3. **Captures** synthesis from flow states
4. **Converts** to artifacts that move projects forward
5. **Reminds** of compelling vision during the grind

## The Deeper Insight

> "Capturing and amplifying and reminding this thing is what you are running towards. The bridge between the troughs."

Brainstorming sessions surface the **compelling run towards** - the big motivating vision. The system should capture this and remind during the grind. It's not just about productivity. It's about maintaining connection to WHY during the mechanical WHAT.

## Convergent Project: Nate Knowledge Graph

This isn't just about archiving Nate's content. It's a **testbed for knowledge graph exploration**:

- Track Nate's thinking, connections, evolution over time
- Practice Neo4j/Graphiti on something juicy and compelling
- Build a demonstrable artifact (calling card for the nerd club)
- Low-stakes experimentation with fantasy-tier ambitions

**The motivation**: Meet the guy. Join the conversation. Show what you can build.

## Engineering Reviews Needed

1. **Graphiti Cost Analysis**
   - Current: ChatGPT hits = expensive
   - Proposal: Haiku via Claude subscription
   - Need: LOE, risk, implementation path
