description: "I closed terminals working on graphiti and Neo4j.   Refresh me what we've done, what we're in the middle of, what is outstanding, recommendations.  I want to figgure out a natural pause on this.   I do not want everthing on input being parsed into Neo4j right now.  I want to ingest after saving in local files for the project.  I need to make sure I'm captuiring enough with usable granularity to get value as is then start experimenting with loading into Neo4j.   ask me questions."
