description: "Before we kick off all 117 in batches, I have a question around how context memory usage and spooling up agents, how that works. This is for my edification about PAI. And also, is compaction a PAI feature or is that happening only through CLOD? I just need to understand before we kick this off and what will it look like? And do I need to start a new continuation prompt or how does this work?"
