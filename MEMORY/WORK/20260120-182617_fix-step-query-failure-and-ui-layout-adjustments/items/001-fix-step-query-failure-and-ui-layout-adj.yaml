description: "I was able to run a query, sample query. I was able to open pipelines and steps. When I tried to run show step, I got a query failure. Please check it out and see what it is. I'd like to make the left column wider or that I can drag it and open it. And can you move the execution buttons run all the way to the left next to the query editor name."
