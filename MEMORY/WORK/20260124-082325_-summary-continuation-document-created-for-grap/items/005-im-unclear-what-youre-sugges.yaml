description: "I'm unclear what you're suggesting for extraction prompt now. What are you suggesting? File-based, then graph, processing for files, extracting out of files, and then using that to then build the graph. Or immediately try to parse it for the graph. In the end, I want to have a file summary that has some of that stuff broken out. Help me understand."
