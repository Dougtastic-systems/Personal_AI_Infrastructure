description: "Alternative thought. The resources seem too tight for this machine. I can make it work, but not well. So, what happens if we had a different parsing pipeline and setup into a Neo4j DB that doesn't use the graffiti temporal time? It sounds interesting, but it seems to be a blocker. Or, what happens if I say, this project is that important to get in, go ahead and wire it back up to a higher model with lower limit rates and just grind through it and pay for it? It seems to be high value in the long"
