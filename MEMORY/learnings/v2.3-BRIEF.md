# PAI v2.3 Brief

**What's New and What It Means**

---

## TL;DR

PAI v2.3 adds three major capabilities:
1. **USER directory** — Your AI learns who you are
2. **TELOS framework** — Connect daily tasks to life goals
3. **Learning loop** — PAI improves from your feedback

All infrastructure is installed. You just need to fill in your personal content.

## The Big Three

### 1. USER Directory — Personal Knowledge Base

**What it is:** A structured place to tell PAI about yourself.

**Key files to create:**
| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `ABOUTME.md` | Who you are, what you do, how you work |
| `TECHSTACKPREFERENCES.md` | Languages, tools, frameworks you prefer |
| `CONTACTS.md` | People you work with (so "send to Mike" has context) |

**Why it matters:** Without this, PAI guesses. With it, PAI knows.

**Location:** `~/.claude/USER/`

---

### 2. TELOS Framework — Life Operating System

**What it is:** A structured way to capture your purpose, goals, and how you think.

**The connection system:**
```
M1: Mission (why you exist)
    ↓
G1: Goal (what you're working toward)
    ↓
C1: Challenge (what's blocking you)
    ↓
S1: Strategy (how you're addressing it)
```

**Start with just two files:**
| File | What to put |
|------|-------------|
| `MISSION.md` | Your 2-3 core life purposes |
| `GOALS.md` | Your current objectives |

**Why it matters:** PAI can connect a task to why it matters in your life.

**Location:** `~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/`

---

### 3. Learning Loop — PAI Gets Better

**What it is:** PAI captures your feedback and learns what works.

**How to use it:**
- Rate responses: "8 - that was helpful" or "3 - not what I wanted"
- Express sentiment: "perfect!" or "no, that's wrong"
- The system captures automatically

**What happens:**
1. Your ratings go to `MEMORY/SIGNALS/`
2. Session insights go to `MEMORY/LEARNINGS/`
3. Status line shows your trend: "Learning: 7.2↑"

**Why it matters:** Over time, PAI learns your preferences without you explicitly teaching it.

### Essential (30 minutes total)
1. Create `~/.claude/USER/ABOUTME.md`

## Known Issue: PAI_DIR Path

**Problem:** Default `settings.json` uses `~/.claude` but hooks fail because `/bin/sh` doesn't expand tildes.

**Fix:** Change `settings.json`:
```json
"env": {
  "PAI_DIR": "/Users/YOURUSERNAME/.claude"
}
```
