# PAI v2.3 Capability Analysis for Dougtastic

**Created:** 2026-01-16
**Purpose:** Systematic understanding of what changed in v2.3 and what it means for you

---

## Executive Summary

You have **all the infrastructure** of v2.3 installed. What's missing is **your personal content** in the new structures. The system is ready - you just need to fill in the USER files.

---

## Capability Inventory

### 1. USER Directory — Personal Knowledge Base

| What Daniel Described | Your Status | Action Needed |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `USER/ABOUTME.md` | **Missing** | Create - tell PAI who you are |
| `USER/DAIDENTITY.md` | **Missing** | Create - customize AI personality beyond settings.json |
| `USER/TECHSTACKPREFERENCES.md` | **Missing** | Create - your language/framework preferences |
| `USER/CONTACTS.md` | **Missing** | Create - people you work with |
| `USER/CORECONTENT.md` | **Missing** | Create - your published work |
| `USER/ASSETMANAGEMENT.md` | **Missing** | Create - domains, sites, digital properties |
| `USER/PAISECURITYSYSTEM/` | **Exists** | Already have custom security patterns |

**What this means for you:**
- Without ABOUTME.md, PAI doesn't know your background, work context, or communication preferences
- Without TECHSTACKPREFERENCES.md, PAI might suggest Python when you prefer TypeScript
- Without CONTACTS.md, when you say "send to Mike", PAI doesn't know which Mike

**Effort:** 30-60 minutes to fill in the essentials (ABOUTME, TECHSTACKPREFERENCES)

---

### 2. TELOS Framework — Life Operating System

| Component | Your Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| TELOS directory | **Exists** at `~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/` | Full template installed |
| MISSION.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| GOALS.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| CHALLENGES.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| STRATEGIES.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| BELIEFS.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| FRAMES.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| MODELS.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| LEARNED.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| WISDOM.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| WRONG.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| BOOKS.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| MOVIES.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| PREDICTIONS.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| PROJECTS.md | Template only | Needs your content |
| STATUS.md | Template only | Needs your content |

**What this means for you:**
The TELOS framework lets you create a structured representation of your life direction:
- **M1 (Mission)** → **G1 (Goal)** → **C1 (Challenge)** → **S1 (Strategy)**
- Everything connects with IDs so PAI can trace from a task to why it matters

**From your backlog, I see these existing priorities:**
- Transcript Pipeline (HIGH)
- Personal Finance System (HIGH)
- Brainstorm Ingestion (TOP PRIORITY per your notes)
- Project/Task/Calendar Module
- Daily Brief System

These would map to TELOS as:
```
M?: Help myself think better and capture insights
  G?: Build transcript pipeline for audio → knowledge
  G?: Create brainstorm ingestion system
    C?: Best thinking happens outside the loop, never gets in
    S?: Morning voice notes, automatic processing
```

**Effort:** Start with MISSION.md and GOALS.md only (15 minutes). Add others over time.

### 3. MEMORY System — Learning From Sessions

| Component | Your Status | Working? |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `MEMORY/learnings/` | **Exists** | ✅ Has your upgrade docs |
| `MEMORY/sessions/` | **Exists** | ✅ Has session summaries |
| `MEMORY/State/` | **Exists** | Empty (fresh start) |
| `ExplicitRatingCapture.hook.ts` | **Installed** | Captures "8 - that was helpful" |
| `ImplicitSentimentCapture.hook.ts` | **Installed** | Detects "nice, that worked" |
| `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` | **Installed** | Extracts insights at session end |
| Status line learning display | **Installed** | Shows "Learning: 7.2↑" |

**What this means for you:**
- When you say "7 - good response" or "3 - not what I wanted", it gets logged
- When you say "nice!" or "ugh", sentiment is captured
- At session end, patterns are extracted
- Over time, PAI learns what works for you

**How to use it:**
- Just rate things naturally: "8 - exactly what I needed"
- Express sentiment: "perfect" or "no, that's wrong"
- The system captures automatically

**Effort:** Zero - just use PAI normally and rate when you feel like it

### 4. SYSTEM/USER Two-Tier Pattern

| Layer | Purpose | Your Status |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| SYSTEM defaults | Base functionality, updates with PAI | ✅ Installed |
| USER overrides | Your customizations, never touched by upgrades | Mostly empty |

**What this means for you:**
- You can customize response format in `USER/RESPONSEFORMAT.md`
- You can add security rules in `USER/PAISECURITYSYSTEM/`
- You can tweak any skill in `USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/SkillName/`
- When PAI upgrades, your customizations are preserved

**Current USER content:**
- `USER/PAISECURITYSYSTEM/` - Exists (your security patterns)
- Everything else - Missing
