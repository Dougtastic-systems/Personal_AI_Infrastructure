## Core Thesis

For the first time in human history, non-engineers can build AI-powered second brains that *actively work* while you sleep - not just passively store notes.

## The Problem with Traditional Systems

- Brains aren't designed for storage - they're designed to think
- Every forced memory = hidden tax (relationships cool, projects fail, anxiety builds)
- Traditional systems ask for cognitive work at the wrong moment (tagging while driving, filing while walking into meetings)
- Result: 95% of people abandon their note systems

## The 2026 Shift

**Before:** AI inside notes as search tool
**After:** AI running a loop that works whether you're motivated or not

The system:
1. Captures thought in 5 seconds
2. Classifies it automatically
3. Routes to right place
4. Extracts relevant details
5. Writes to structured database
6. Nudges you each morning with what matters

## The Architecture (8 Building Blocks)

### 1. Dropbox (Capture Point)
- Single Slack channel called "SB Inbox"
- One message per thought, no organizing
- Zero decisions at capture time

### 2. Bouncer (Confidence Filter)
- Claude/GPT with confidence score (0-1)
- If below threshold (0.6), asks for clarification
- Prevents garbage from polluting memory

### 3. Sorter (Router/Classifier)
- Routes to: People, Projects, Ideas, Admin
- Uses structured JSON schema
- Extracts relevant details automatically

### 4. Form (Data Schema)
- Each database has ~5 fields max
- Person: name, context, follow-ups, last touched
- Project: name, status, next action, notes
- Idea: name, oneliner, notes, tags
- Admin: name, due date, status

### 5. Receipt (Audit Trail)
- Inbox log showing what came in, what system did, confidence level
- Essential for building trust

### 6. Filing Cabinet (Storage)
- Notion with 4 databases
- Writable by automation, readable by humans
- Simple views filtered by status, date, tags

### 7. Tap on Shoulder (Proactive Surfacing)
- Daily digest: 3 suggested actions, open loops, one thing you might be stuck on
- Weekly review: what's stuck, what's moving, focus areas
- Arrives via Slack DM at scheduled time

### 8. Fix Button (Human-in-Loop Correction)
- Reply "fix" in thread to correct misclassification
- Makes corrections trivial
- System learns from fixes

## The 12 Engineering Principles

1. **Reduce human's job to ONE reliable behavior** - capture only
2. **Separate memory from compute from interface** - each layer has one job
3. **Treat prompts like APIs** - fixed input/output schema, no surprises
4. **Start simple, stay simple** - add sophistication later only if needed
5. **Default to safe behavior when uncertain** - log don't file if unsure
6. **Make output small, frequent, actionable** - fits on phone screen
7. **Use "next action" as unit of value** - not notes, not ideas
8. **Prefer routing over categories** - 4 buckets, not taxonomies
9. **Keep fields painfully small** - 5 max per database
10. **Build for restart, not perfection** - easy to pick back up after falling off
11. **Build ONE reliable behavior** - one capture point, one action, one habit
12. **Optimize for maintainability over cleverness** - fewer tools, fewer steps

## The Stack

- **Interface:** Slack (capture)
- **Automation:** Zapier (routing, scheduling)
- **Compute:** Claude or ChatGPT (classification, summarization)
- **Storage:** Notion (4 databases + inbox log)

## Implementation Steps

1. Create Slack channel "SB Inbox" (private, pinned message explaining purpose)
2. Create Notion databases: People, Projects, Ideas, Admin, Inbox Log
3. Connect Zapier: Slack → Claude → Notion
4. Set up daily digest automation
5. Set up weekly review automation

## Key Quotes

> "The fastest way to kill a system is to fill it with garbage. The bouncer keeps your second brain from becoming a junk drawer."

> "You're not building a productivity system. You're installing a behavior-changing system."

> "The center of gravity moves from you as the person who has to keep all of this organized to the system pushing useful information to you at the right time."
