Prompting is way too hard. It’s hard to remember to prompt well. It’s hard to think of prompts. It’s hard to keep them in order. It’s hard to use them for the right model and the right output.



You get all that.



I want to talk about why prompting is hard, because I think we’re missing some basic language that would help us to understand, skill up, and prompt more effectively.



At heart, prompting is the art of figuring out how to talk to an alien intelligence. LLMs interpret language really differently than we do, and remembering that helps me to stay calm when I have prompt challenges like this:








[](https://substack.com/redirect/2a8839d8-f187-4682-b4b8-3f6592b1caba?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)









If we want to avoid squirrel-on-unicycle problems, it’s not good enough to just bang our heads on the keyboard.



We have to evolve a language for talking about prompting that makes sense. We need to have an agreed set of terms for prompt stages that helps us understand and name the process we all go through when we make a prompt.



And honestly I think we’re missing one. We don’t have a language for talking about how we get a prompt from idea to done. And when we can’t talk about it as distinct stages, we mostly just muddle through.



This may sound like shaving the yak, but I promise you it’s going to get very real very quickly, because it turns out that when you actually take apart the prompt lifecycle and think it through, a gaping hole in our thinking emerges.
Can you find it?



Here are the five stages of the prompt for which we have tools and which we talk about all the time—a sixth stage is missing! Can you spot it?



1.
Authoring and drafting—getting the words right



a.
Most of us do this in ChatGPT realistically



b.
But there are some great prompt tools as well



2.
Storage, Versioning, Collaboration



a.
There are specialized tools here for individuals & teams



3.
Evaluation, Testing, Benchmarking



a.
Mostly only teams do this, and there are definitely tools



4.
Workflow Construction & Automation



a.
Lots of tools here, getting into agent management



5.
Deployment, Production, & Integration



a.
Software engineering tools here for prompt deployment



So what’s missing? Intent! There is almost nothing at all out there for ideation and intent formation in prompting. In fact, we don’t even
*talk *about it.



Intent goes at the beginning. So let’s add a new #1 right at the top of our list:




1.
**Ideation & intent—figuring out our prompt intent precisely**



a.
There are NO tools here, weirdly



b.
But we all do it all the time! Mostly in our heads



So here’s what’s in the box:



1.
For all of you prompt nerds out there, I am covering all 6 stages of prompting



a.
We will go into each category in depth



b.
We’ll also go through 19 different tools used for prompting



c.
AND, I’m going to give you a custom prompt to help you figure out what stage you need to focus on



2.
But we’re not done yet! I’m also going to introduce a tool I built for stage 1: prompt ideation and intent



a.
I have a live demo on it in the video




i. Including a code prompt example




ii. And a deck prompt example



b.
And a 70% off forever discount code



c.
And a chance to join me in slack to give product feedback



Look, the tool isn’t perfect. I’m not going to pretend it is, because I believe you should launch your tools when they add value, not when they’re perfect.



I’m trying to demonstrate in public what it looks like to see a problem, build something for it, and launch it when you feel slightly uncomfortable. It’s a skill I talk a lot about, and I want to actually show the reality of doing
that step-by-step here.

Prompt Lifecycle Assessment Prompt](https://substack.com/redirect/a5fd439a-4b7b-401a-b63d-78c065137db0?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)



This prompt transforms your LLM into a “Prompt Lifecycle Architect,” a diagnostic consultant designed to professionalize your prompt engineering workflow by moving you beyond simple trial-and-error.




Through a series of incisive, probing questions, the model assesses your habits against a six-stage framework—distinguishing between superficial wordsmithing and deep intent formation—to pinpoint exactly where your process is breaking
down.



It concludes the session with a rigorous analysis of your specific strengths and operational blind spots, ultimately prescribing one tailored tool (from a curated list of 19) to resolve your most critical bottleneck and elevate your
skills from hobbyist to engineer.

The Prompt Lifecycle: A Framework We’ve Been Missing



Most people talk about prompt engineering techniques. Almost nobody talks about the stages of prompt work itself.



I’ve spent the last few months sitting with people as they struggle with prompting, and here’s what I keep seeing: most bad prompts fail before they’re written. The task is under-specified. The constraints are unclear. The output
format is an afterthought. But practitioners treat these as drafting problems—wordsmithing when they should be thinking.



I know you feel it too. You paste something into ChatGPT, it doesn’t quite work, so you tweak the wording. Tweak it again. Maybe add “be concise” or “think step by step.” Sometimes that helps. Sometimes you’re just rearranging deck
chairs.



The problem isn’t your words. It’s that you haven’t figured out what you actually want.



This piece is about fixing that. I’m going to lay out a six-stage lifecycle for prompt work, show you where the tools actually live, and explain why the most important stage has almost no tooling at all.



Let’s dig in.


##
Why We Need a Map



Here’s the thing: we’ve spent two years obsessing over prompt engineering techniques. Chain-of-thought versus few-shot. System prompts versus inline instructions. Temperature tuning. We’ve built tooling for version control, evaluation
pipelines, production monitoring.



What we haven’t done is map the actual stages of prompt work and figure out which tools serve which purposes.



That gap matters. People pick up tools that solve the wrong problem. They struggle at stages where no tooling exists. They conflate fundamentally different kinds of work.



Stay with me—I’m going to make this concrete.


##
Six Stages, One Diagnostic Framework



Prompts have a lifecycle, kind of like code. Vague intentions become working artifacts, get tested and versioned, and eventually run in production. The difference? Software engineering has had decades to build tooling for each stage.
We’ve had about eighteen months.



The value of mapping this isn’t academic—it’s diagnostic. When something isn’t working, the framework tells you where the problem actually lives.








[](https://substack.com/redirect/701151b6-ecf9-4e36-b4d6-77419c1e4c69?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)








###
Stage 1: Intent Formation



This is where you translate fuzzy goals into structured requirements—before any wording happens. “Summarize this” becomes a specification: what length, what emphasis, what format, what the reader needs to do with it afterward.



Stage 1 isn’t about wording. It’s about defining the task in a way a model can reliably execute.



Here’s the thing: general-purpose models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini can assist here, but they’re not built for it. They’ll improve whatever you give them. They won’t systematically walk you through objectives, constraints,
output formats, and edge cases. You have to already know to ask for that structure.



This is the stage with the highest failure rate and the least tooling. Of the roughly nineteen tools in the prompt ecosystem, almost all serve Stages 2 through 6. Stage 1 is nearly empty.



I built [
HeyPresto](https://substack.com/redirect/7702c5e3-a770-4db2-82ac-a1e2de839f44?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU) specifically to address this gap—it’s an intent-to-prompt engine that takes vague input and expands it into a structured prompt with objectives, constraints, and format specifications. Paste in “help me write
a deck about X” and you get back slide-by-slide structure with content guidance. It doesn’t replace your thinking—it helps you crystallize intent you already have into a form that models can execute reliably.



If you want to hack around in ChatGPT instead, bless you. I’ve certainly done it. But I kept running into the same wall, which is why I built the thing.


###
Stage 2: Authoring and Drafting



Once intent is structured, Stage 2 turns that structure into actual language. Now you’re iterating on wording, role definitions, examples, tone.



The tooling here clusters into four buckets:



**Model interfaces** like OpenAI Playground and Claude’s console give you direct access with parameter controls. This is where most people live.



**Optimizers** like PromptPerfect (from Jina AI) auto-refine wording and structure, with optional cross-model variant testing. You’re still working on
the text of the prompt, but you’re getting help tuning it.



**Structured IDEs** like Promptmetheus break prompts into modular blocks—Context, Task, Instructions, Shots—with cost estimation and collaboration features.
It bridges into Stages 3 and 4, which is useful if you’re getting serious about prompt management.



**AI-first coding environments** like Cursor, Lovable, and Google’s Antigravity collapse prompting into execution. Lovable turns natural-language specs
into running web apps. Antigravity orchestrates multiple agents across editor, terminal, and browser. The prompt becomes the product—you skip straight from drafting to deployed artifact.


###
Stage 3: Storage and Versioning



When prompts prove valuable enough to reuse, they become assets that require coordination. Teams store them, diff them, name versions, review changes. The prompt is no longer ephemeral—it’s infrastructure.



This is one of the places where we start to see a real split between individuals and teams. If you’re a serious individual, you might have a little Notion database where you keep your prompts. That works. But teams who are using
production-grade prompts need something more robust.



PromptLayer dominates here: a model-agnostic prompt CMS that versions prompts separately from code, diffs changes, and tracks production usage. It spans this stage and Stage 6. Promptmetheus serves similar needs through its project
system. Git-based approaches work if you’re already comfortable with version control, though they lack prompt-specific tooling.


###
Stage 4: Evaluation and Testing



Reusable prompts need reliability guarantees. This is where prompts get regression tests—systematic comparison against test cases, assessment of accuracy and cost, cross-model consistency checks.



Let me be honest: this stage is fundamentally team-oriented. Individuals rarely build formal evaluation suites. If you’re a solo builder, you’re probably testing ad hoc—maybe 10 or 15 queries you run manually to see if a new version
works better. That’s fine for most use cases. But teams using production-grade prompts will build entire suites of 50, 100 tests that run automatically in a pipeline against a new version.



Hegel’s PromptTools provides open-source infrastructure for this: experiments across prompts and models, logged results, CI/CD integration. Microsoft’s PromptFlow offers end-to-end tooling within Azure AI. LangSmith handles tracing
and debugging for teams using LangChain.


###
Stage 5: Workflow Construction



Here’s where things get interesting. Stage 5 is the transition from prompt-as-instruction to prompt-as-policy. Prompts stop being one-offs and become control surfaces for agents—wired into conditional logic, orchestrators, multi-step
automations.



The prompt becomes the beating heart of the agent. It’s what helps you predictably guide agentic behavior.



LangChain is the most widely adopted framework here, orchestrating prompts, tools, memory, and retrieval with LangGraph providing graph-based agent workflows. Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) offers similar capabilities within
Vertex AI. ReAct (Reason + Act) isn’t a tool but the prompting paradigm—interleaving reasoning with actions—that shaped this entire stage.


###
Stage 6: Production Deployment



Running prompts at scale introduces new failure modes: model updates, hallucination regressions, cost drift. Production prompts need logging, monitoring, and governance. You have to have production robustness, safety, traceability—the
same stuff you’d need for any production system.



The runtime targets are OpenAI’s API (GPT-4, o3/o4 reasoning models) and Anthropic’s Claude API (direct and via AWS Bedrock). The observability layer combines PromptLayer (versioning plus production monitoring), LangSmith (tracing
and debugging), and PromptFlow (managed deployment endpoints).



I put this all together into a graphic using Nano Banana Pro:








[](https://substack.com/redirect/5304bb0b-9678-4ee8-921f-c511abdb9277?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)








##
The Distribution Problem



So here’s the punchline: the ecosystem skews hard toward Stages 2–6. Stage 1 has one purpose-built tool and little else.



This creates a predictable failure mode. Practitioners stuck at intent formation reach for drafting tools. They ask an LLM to “improve this prompt” when what they actually need is help figuring out what they want. The tool optimizes
their words. It doesn’t surface the missing constraints, undefined outputs, or unconsidered edge cases.



It’s like asking someone to proofread your essay when you haven’t figured out your thesis yet. The proofreading might be excellent. It’s not going to fix the underlying problem.


##
Why Intent Formation Gets Ignored



The gap persists because intent formation masquerades as thinking, when it’s actually specification—and specifications benefit from tooling.



There’s a difference between tools that optimize inputs and tools that help you structure your intent. PromptPerfect refines wording. Promptmetheus structures blocks. Both assume the task is already clear.



Stage 1 requires something else: a system that helps you work through what prompts need—objectives, constraints, output formats, edge cases—before you start drafting.


##
The Individual-Team Divide



One thing that makes this whole space tricky: prompting straddles two very different worlds.



Individuals work fluidly—iterating in ChatGPT, maintaining a personal prompt library, testing informally. Teams require governance: version control, audit trails, test suites, deployment monitoring.



The tooling reflects this. Stages 4 through 6 assume engineering resources and production requirements. Individual builders find diminishing support past the basic model interfaces.



Stage 1 cuts across both. Whether you’re a solo creator prototyping in Lovable or a PM at a Fortune 500 company, you start with fuzzy intentions that need structure. The thinking upgrade is valuable regardless of what comes after.


##
A Diagnostic Checklist



When prompt work isn’t producing results, locate the problem:



**Goal is unclear** → Stage 1 problem. No amount of wordsmithing fixes an under-specified task. Back up and define objectives, constraints, and outputs.



**Wording is messy** → Stage 2. Use drafting tools, optimizers, or structured IDEs to refine the text.



**Reliability is drifting** → Stage 4. Build test cases. Run evaluations. Treat the prompt like code that needs regression tests.



**Execution is failing in production** → Stage 5 or 6. Check orchestration logic, monitoring, and deployment configuration.


##
The Missing Piece



The prompt lifecycle has six stages. Five have competitive tooling markets. One—the stage where everything starts—remains underserved.



This matters because downstream quality depends on upstream clarity. The best evaluation framework can’t fix a prompt built on fuzzy intent. The most sophisticated agent architecture can’t compensate for undefined objectives.



I could be wrong about the specific tools or the exact boundaries between stages. But I’m confident about the core claim: we’ve been treating prompting like it starts when you sit down to write. It doesn’t. It starts when you figure
out what you actually want.



Every downstream failure in prompt engineering begins as an upstream failure of intent.

HeyPresto](https://substack.com/redirect/7702c5e3-a770-4db2-82ac-a1e2de839f44?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)



This is the part where people usually roll their eyes. “Nate has sold out. He’s shilling his stupid little product.”



I get it. And I’m not going to pretend this is the best tool for everything—that’s why I spent the first half of this piece walking through all the other stages and all the other great tools that exist. I do not believe in a world
where there’s one prompt tool for everything.



But I do believe we’re missing something at Stage 1. And that’s why I built HeyPresto.



Here’s my thinking on pricing: if we’re talking about prompt tooling, it needs to be different depending on whether you’re a team solution or an individual. For individuals—especially people who are already part of my Substack community—I
don’t want this to feel extra fancy or complicated. So if you’re a member, you get a coupon code for 70% off forever, which makes it something like seven bucks a month. I want it to be super easy to try. If it’s useful, great. If it’s not for you, that’s fine
too.



And to make it easy, here’s the discount code:
HEYPRESTOSUBSTACKSPECIAL



On my side, I’m committing to continuing to make it better. I’m opening up a Slack channel into my working Slack for people who are using HeyPresto so they can give direct feedback to me and a couple other builders who are working
on this. My goal is to solve that fuzzy intent stage. I don’t need to make this super big. I just want to serve the community around a need I’ve found.



I also think it’s important to actually build things and launch them if you talk about AI all the time. If I’m going to spend my days telling people how to use AI tools, I should probably be building some too. That’s part of why
I’m putting this out there.



If you disagree with me—if you think intent formulation isn’t the right framing for the first stage of prompting—I’d love to hear what you think it actually is. Because I’m pretty confident it’s not “authoring.” Either way, I had
fun building HeyPresto, and I’m offering it in the spirit of trying something with the community and seeing if it helps.



Let’s keep learning together.
