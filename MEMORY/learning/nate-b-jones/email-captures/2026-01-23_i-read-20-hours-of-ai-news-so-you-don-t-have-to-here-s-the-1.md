This week, AI started prompting me. Not the other way around.



It was surreal to start to see ChatGPT set a news angle for the day every morning (that’s their new Pulse product in action.)



It’s hyper-relevant, almost eerily so. And it gives me a glimpse into the future where AI will just handle stuff for us overnight.



Stepping back, we’re seeing three key themes out of the stories this week: proactive AI that works while you sleep, tech giants abandoning exclusivity for multi-model strategies, and the first real AI agents that complete end-to-end
tasks.


##
Top Stories


-
**OpenAI launched proactive AI** that works while you sleep, delivering morning briefings based on your data
-
**Microsoft ditched AI exclusivity**, integrating Anthropic’s Claude alongside OpenAI in enterprise tools
-
**Meta explored partnering with Google** on ad targeting, signaling revenue trumps rivalry
-
**OpenAI announced autonomous data centers** that operate as lights-out “AI factories”
-
**Chinese startup Kimi deployed true AI agents** that build websites and dashboards from chat requests
-
**Adobe imported best-in-class AI models** rather than competing with proprietary development
-
**California passed comprehensive AI safety legislation** creating the first major state-level framework


*Plus, I Want to Make This More Useful for You!*


Reading AI news without extracting actionable insights is like collecting data without analysis. You know something important happened, but you can’t connect it to your actual work.



So I’m including the Implications Mapper—a structured prompt that takes any AI brief and forces out the concrete implications for your role and industry. No more “that’s interesting” and moving on. You get five specific implications,
what to ignore, what signals to track, and what happens if you don’t act.

##
Now, let’s prompt the news…



I keep seeing the same problem: people read AI news and then... nothing. They know something important happened, but they can’t figure out what it means for their actual work.



The **Implications Mapper** fixes this. It’s a structured prompt that takes any AI brief and forces out the domain-specific implications that matter. No more “that’s
interesting” and moving on. You get five concrete implications, what to ignore, what signals to track, and what happens if you don’t act.



The **Ultra-short version** does the same thing in half the words for when you’re sharing via DM or social.



Both include an optional “/ACTIONABLE” switch if you want a low-effort experiment to try, not just analysis to sit on.







##
Full Prompts



So I gave you two prompts here. The first one takes slightly more effort but gets you deeper into the news and its implications for you. The second is more grab ‘n go, and it gets you quick customization. You choose what works for
you!


###
Implications mapper


You are my Implications Mapper.

INPUTS
[ROLE]= (optional; e.g., CMO, PM, Teacher)
[DOMAIN]= (e.g., retail media, healthcare, higher ed, indie games)
[COMPANY]= (optional; use only for framing)
[CONTEXT]= (optional constraints, e.g., EU user base, <20 ppl team)
NEWS=<<< paste this week’s AI brief >>>

TASK
From NEWS only (no outside facts), produce a tight readout for [DOMAIN] (and [COMPANY] if given).

OUTPUT (max 220 words, plain English, no hype, no to-dos):
1) **5 implications (0–12 months)** — one line each:
• What it changes, for whom, and why now.
• Tag each line: (Fact) if straight from NEWS, (Inference) if reasoned.
2) **What to ignore this week** — one line (why it likely doesn’t matter here).
3) **What to watch (30–90 days)** — three concrete signals to track.
4) **If we ignore this** — one-line consequence for [DOMAIN]/[COMPANY].

RULES
- Use only NEWS and INPUTS; don’t invent numbers or quotes.
- One idea per line. No adjectives you can’t defend from NEWS.
- If uncertain, write “[TK—confirm]” at the end of the line.

OPTIONAL SWITCH
If I add the word **/ACTIONABLE**, append a final section:
5) **One low-lift experiment** (≤1 hr or $100) that fits [CONTEXT].

###
Ultra-short version (for socials / DMs)

INPUTS
[ROLE]= (optional; e.g., CMO, PM, Teacher)
[DOMAIN]= (e.g., retail media, healthcare, higher ed, indie games)
[COMPANY]= (optional; use only for framing)
[CONTEXT]= (optional constraints, e.g., EU user base, <20 ppl team)
NEWS=<<< paste this week’s AI brief >>>

Turn this week’s AI brief into **my domain-specific implications**:
- 5 one-line implications (tag Fact/Inference)
- 1 thing to ignore
- 3 signals to watch (30–90d)
- 1 “if we ignore this” line

Use only my pasted brief.
No tasks unless I add /ACTIONABLE.






That’s the news that matters!



20 hours of AI news following distilled into 15 minutes + a prompt :)



Enjoy the weekend…big news coming next week.
