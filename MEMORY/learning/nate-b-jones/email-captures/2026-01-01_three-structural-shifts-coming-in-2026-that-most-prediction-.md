In 2025, AI delivered on the productivity promise — and that turned out to be the problem.




Not the kind of problem where the technology fell short, but the kind where it worked so well that it surfaced a bottleneck nobody had planned for. Marketing teams discovered they could generate more creative assets in a week than they used to produce in a
quarter, which was exciting right up until someone had to review all of it. Product managers found they could spin up draft requirements and specifications faster than ever, but the drafts needed human judgment before they could ship. Engineers could generate
code at a pace that would have seemed impossible two years ago, and then they had to read every line because hallucinations are real and production bugs are expensive.



The tools work. That’s not the issue. The issue is that we’ve finally achieved the ability to produce at a scale that completely overwhelms our capacity to verify, and most of us are still trying to solve this with the same manual review processes we’ve always
used. You have Claude draft a document, then spend almost as long checking it as writing would have taken. You generate code, then audit it line by line. You get research summaries, then verify each claim by hand. The generation problem is solved, but the
review problem is crushing us.



But there’s a small number of teams — mostly in engineering, mostly at companies that have been deep in AI tooling for a while — who figured out something that the rest of us need to learn. They stopped trying to review everything themselves. Instead, they
built systems where AI reviews AI: eval harnesses that check outputs against specifications, judge models that flag inconsistencies, automated QA loops that catch errors before a human ever sees them. These teams are still rare, but they’re not experimenting
anymore. They’re shipping. And the way they work is a map for the rest of us — because the shift from “humans review everything” to “AI reviews AI, humans handle exceptions” isn’t just an engineering workflow optimization. It’s a fundamental change in how
knowledge work gets done, and it’s coming for all of us whether we’re ready or not.



I have three bets for 2026. Not the same predictions that blur together with every other year-end forecast — three structural shifts that will catch people off guard because they’re about what changes in how you work, not what changes in what AI can do.



**Here’s what’s inside:**


-


**The review stack flips** — AI starts reviewing AI. Humans handle exceptions. This sounds like efficiency, but it’s actually an identity crisis — and the new bottleneck isn’t reviewing outputs, it’s writing testable intent in the first place.


-


**Work becomes testable** — At frontier companies, every role starts looking like a creative QA function. The wall between “technical” and “non-technical” dissolves. What’s on the other side isn’t engineering exactly — it’s the ability to
specify work precisely enough that automated systems can evaluate it.


-


**The chasm opens** — The gap between fast movers and everyone else becomes unbridgeable. Not because fast companies “adopt AI” — because they’ve built auditability and rollback into how they operate. The compounding advantage is organizational
learning rate, and catching up requires more than tools.


-


**4 prompts** designed to stress-test your readiness for each of these shifts.









If you’re making decisions about 2026 — budgets, hiring, skills development, your own career — these are the shifts I’d be watching. Not the flashiest predictions, but the ones most likely to catch people off guard.

**Why these matter:** The failure mode with pieces like this is nodding along and changing nothing. You read, find it interesting, go back to working exactly as before. The gap between “intellectually understanding” and “actually ready” is
large. These prompts exist to close it.



**What’s included:**


-


**Topology transition assessment** — Evaluates how ready your workflows are for review inversion. Where are you stuck in “human reviews everything” mode? What specification skills do you need? What breaks when you try to move to AI-reviewed
work without prerequisites? This one gets uncomfortable.


-


**Testability diagnostic** — Takes a workflow you own and pressure-tests whether it can survive the shift. Where are your specs vague? What would an eval harness look like? What’s your iteration loop? Most people think they’re closer to testable
work than they are.


-


**Organizational learning rate audit** — Hard questions about whether your company is building compounding advantage or just using tools. Asks for specifics, not vibes. Outputs honest assessment of where you sit and what moving would require
— including whether it’s realistic given your culture.





These are blunt by design. If you want reassurance, don’t use them. If you want to know where you stand before the shifts hit, they’ll tell you.


##
**Bet One: The Review Stack Flips**



If every hour of AI output requires thirty minutes of human review, you’re capped at 2-3x productivity improvement. For high-stakes work where errors are costly, the cap is lower. The 10x gains people talk about? Not possible under that topology.



In 2026, the topology flips.


###
**What actually changes**



Here’s the workflow that becomes normal at companies paying attention:



AI generates output. A second AI layer reviews that output — checking for consistency, completeness, adherence to requirements, factual accuracy, logical coherence. Issues get flagged with confidence scores. Only flagged items, plus a sample of “confident”
outputs, reach human reviewers.



The human role shifts from “check everything” to “handle exceptions and calibrate the system.”



Engineering teams are already doing this. They call it different things — eval loops, automated QA, judge models — but the pattern is the same. Code gets generated, tested against criteria, reviewed by a second model for issues tests don’t catch, then queued
for human attention. The human isn’t reading every diff anymore. They’re reading failing tests, model rationales, flagged risk items.



What unlocks this broadly in 2026 isn’t a single breakthrough. It’s the maturation of pieces that have been developing separately: structured outputs that constrain model responses to checkable formats, LLM-as-judge patterns becoming standard tooling,
eval frameworks shipping as default infrastructure rather than custom builds. Costs and latency for multi-pass critique are falling enough that more teams can afford to run review loops that would have been prohibitively expensive a year ago. 2026 is when
these pieces work well enough *together* to change the default.



**The tell you’ll see inside real teams:** Review queues segmented by confidence tier. “High confidence” outputs go to spot-check sampling. “Medium confidence” gets expedited human review. “Low confidence” gets full attention. In workflows
where the pieces are in place, total volume of human review can drop by more than half — and the
*value* of that review increases because attention concentrates where it matters.



**The metric that shifts:** Percentage of AI outputs requiring human review before shipping. For high-stakes work in 2025, it’s close to 100%. The shape of the target I’m hearing from teams at the frontier: sample plus exceptions, not blanket
review. Not because they’re reckless — because the AI review layer catches what humans would have caught.


###
**The bottleneck moves upstream**



When review stops being the constraint, what becomes the constraint?



The assumption is “nothing — we just go faster.” That’s wrong.



The new bottleneck is specification. Your ability to write intent that’s testable.



Think about what makes AI review possible. The reviewing AI needs criteria to check against. If your original request was “write something good,” there’s nothing for the review layer to verify. “Good” isn’t testable. The review AI can check grammar and maybe
catch factual errors, but it can’t evaluate whether output achieves what you wanted — because you never specified what you wanted in checkable terms.



The people who thrive under the inverted topology can write specifications that
*enable* automated review. Not “write a marketing email” but “write a marketing email that hits these three value props, stays under 200 words, matches this tone profile, doesn’t make claims we can’t substantiate.” That’s a spec the review
layer can check against.



Most people don’t have this skill. We’re used to reviewing outputs ourselves, which means we can be vague about intent — we’ll know-it-when-we-see-it later. That worked when humans were the review layer. It breaks when review is automated and needs explicit
criteria.



**The cost nobody’s pricing in:** The inverted topology is faster, but not easier. It shifts effort from review to specification. If you can’t write testable intent, you don’t get the benefits — you’re still stuck reviewing everything yourself
because the AI review layer has nothing to check against.


###
**The identity shift**



This creates an identity problem for a lot of knowledge workers, and I don’t think we should pretend otherwise.



Professional identity is often tied to craft — the lawyer who constructs arguments, the analyst who builds models, the writer who finds the right words. When AI handles drafting and AI handles the first rounds of review, what’s left? You’re not doing the work
anymore. You’re specifying what the work should accomplish and judging edge cases.



That’s valuable. Organizations will pay well for people who write precise specs and make good calls on ambiguous exceptions. But it doesn’t
*feel* the same. The satisfaction of craft gets replaced by something closer to quality assurance at scale.



The status game changes too. Today, status comes from producing excellent work. In the new world, status comes from one of two places — and neither looks like traditional craft.



The first path is exception handling: being the person who makes the hard calls when automated review hits its limits. In legal, this looks like the senior counsel who triages flagged contracts, who knows which deviations from standard terms actually matter
and which are noise. The judgment is valuable precisely because it requires context and experience that can’t be automated — but only if you can demonstrate the outcomes.



The second path is system architecture: designing the gates, criteria, and escalation logic that determine what gets flagged in the first place. In marketing, this looks like the brand lead who builds the rubric that AI scores content against, who maintains
the library of allowed and banned claims, who curates the golden set of exemplars that define what on-brand actually means. This isn’t engineering in the traditional sense — you can be a marketing lead or a general counsel and still be the architect. The work
is specifying what quality looks like so machines can check for it.



Both paths require instrumentation. If you’re handling exceptions but not tracking which ones, what judgment you applied, and what the outcomes were — you can’t prove the moat is real. If you’re architecting systems but not measuring whether they catch errors
and reduce rework — you’re building on faith. The status comes from the work being legible and measurable, not just from doing it.



This is the new way value becomes legible. Not “I produced this” but “I caught this, I built the system that flags this, and here’s the data that proves it matters.”


###
**A failure mode that isn’t getting attention: invisible correlated errors**



Everyone talks about hallucinations. Fewer people talk about what happens when your review AI has the same blindspots as your generation AI.



If both models were trained on similar data with similar assumptions, they fail in correlated ways. Generation AI makes a subtle error. Review AI, with similar biases baked in, doesn’t catch it. Output looks checked and verified. It’s not.



This is worse than a hallucination you can spot. It’s an error that passed review, which means you trust it more than you should. The principle to internalize: don’t let the same model family certify itself without independent checks.



The teams that navigate this well will build diverse review layers: multiple models from different providers, non-model checks (rule-based validation, domain-specific heuristics), golden-set drift tracking to catch when review quality degrades. The ones that
just chain one model’s output to the same family’s review will learn expensive lessons about correlated failure.





##
**Bet Two: Work Becomes Testable**



Here’s the uncomfortable version of “everyone learns to work with AI”: by late 2026, at frontier companies, most roles become creative QA functions.



That phrase needs unpacking, because “QA” triggers the wrong mental model. Traditional QA is manual, repetitive, checkbox work — clicking through test cases, verifying that buttons do what they’re supposed to do. Creative QA is something different. It’s owning
quality by designing the criteria that systems check against, not by personally checking every output. It’s the difference between reviewing a hundred pieces of content yourself and building the rubric that lets AI review a thousand pieces while you handle
the ten that get flagged.



Non-technical work doesn’t become technical. It becomes testable. Your primary job shifts from producing the work to defining what “good” looks like precisely enough that automated systems can evaluate it.


###
**What this looks like**



**Marketing becomes brand testing.** The job isn’t “write social posts.” It’s “define brand voice specs precisely enough that AI can generate content and AI can evaluate it.” That means building artifacts: a rubric models can score against,
a library of allowed claims and banned claims, a golden set of on-brand exemplars that establish the target. The more precise these artifacts, the more you can delegate. The vaguer the spec, the more you’re stuck reviewing everything manually.



**Operations becomes workflow versioning.** Ops teams start treating workflows as deployable artifacts: versioned, auditable, reversible. When your workflow is “AI does steps 1-5, human intervenes at decision points, AI does steps 6-10,”
you need infrastructure to know what changed when something breaks. Rollback matters because debugging matters. Audit logs matter because incident response matters. Companies that build this will have answers when things go wrong. Companies running ad-hoc
“we just use AI now” won’t.



**Analysis becomes eval design.** The analyst’s job shifts from “build the model, interpret results” to “specify what questions matter, define how answers get validated, design evals that catch errors.” You’re still the domain expert. But
you’re not manually running numbers — you’re designing systems that run and validate them. What would a wrong answer look like? What checks catch mistakes before they reach decision-makers?



The common thread: domain expertise becomes the ability to write tests for judgment. What used to be tacit knowledge in your head — “I know good marketing copy when I see it” — has to become explicit criteria machines can evaluate.


###
**The new seniority signal**



Here’s a tell I expect to see as this shift takes hold: job postings outside engineering start reading like engineering postings. Not because everyone becomes a developer, but because the underlying skills converge. You’ll see marketing roles asking for “experience
building evaluation frameworks for content quality.” Operations postings that want “ability to write precise specifications for automated workflows.” Finance positions requiring “comfort with iterative testing and validation processes.” HR roles looking for
“experience defining measurable criteria for candidate assessment.”



This is still early, and I want to be careful not to overstate how far along we are. You’ll see it first in teams where AI output volume is already overwhelming human review capacity — the teams that had no choice but to figure this out. It will spread unevenly,
hitting some functions and industries faster than others. But the direction is clear, and the companies that are furthest ahead are already hiring this way.



The new seniority signal won’t be years of experience or depth of domain knowledge alone. It’ll be whether you can design evals that don’t get gamed. Can you write success criteria that actually capture what you care about, rather than proxies that get optimized
into meaninglessness? Can you tell when an automated system is hitting your metrics but missing the point?



That’s a different skill than traditional expertise. Some people with deep domain knowledge will be great at it. Some won’t. Tenure stops predicting value as cleanly as it used to.



A useful gut check: think about the last piece of work you delegated, whether to a person or an AI. Could someone else — someone with no context on what you wanted — evaluate whether the output was good enough? If the answer is no, the criteria were in your
head, not on the page. That’s the gap this shift exposes.



**The uncomfortable truth:** If you can’t write evals, you will be managed by someone who can. The work you used to get promoted for — the craftsmanship, the execution, the domain fluency — becomes the work that gets automated. What remains
is specification and exception-handling. If your expertise can’t be turned into checks, it gets treated as “taste” — and taste loses budget fights to metrics.





##
**Bet Three: The Chasm Opens**



My final bet is about distribution.



The gap between fast-moving organizations and everyone else will widen dramatically in 2026. By year-end, the top 5-10% of companies and the bottom 50% will be operating in different economic realities — visible in cycle time, quality consistency, headcount
efficiency.



“Some companies adopt faster” is obvious. What I think people underestimate is why the gap compounds and how fast it becomes unbridgeable.


###
**The compounding mechanism isn’t adoption — it’s auditability**



The consensus framing: fast companies adopt AI, slow companies don’t, fast companies gain advantage. True but shallow.



The fast companies aren’t just using AI. They’re building auditability and rollback into their organizational DNA.



What does that mean concretely? They’re capturing data on what works: which prompts, which specs, which workflows. They’re building eval harnesses that measure output quality systematically. They’re logging processes so they can see what changed when
something breaks. They’re versioning workflows so they can roll back and compare. They’re creating feedback loops that make the
*organization* learn, not just individuals.



This adds up to something that deserves a name, because it’s becoming a new category of organizational work. Think of it as agent legibility — the ability to see what your AI systems are actually doing, and why. As agents take on more tasks across more functions,
the organizations that pull ahead will be the ones that can answer a basic set of questions: What did the agent do? Why did it make that choice? What changed between the version that worked and the version that didn’t? If something goes wrong, can we roll
it back?



These aren’t compliance questions — the kind you answer once for an audit and forget about. They’re learning questions. The difference is what happens after you answer them. A compliance answer gets filed. A learning answer gets fed back into the system: you
update the prompt, you tighten the spec, you add a check that catches the failure mode next time. Learning questions are how the organization gets smarter, not just how it covers itself. Organizations that can answer them compound their advantage every week.
Organizations that can’t are flying blind, even if their AI is technically working.



When you have this infrastructure, every week of AI usage makes you better at AI usage. You see what produces good outputs and what doesn’t. You catch failure modes and fix them. The learning compounds.



When you don’t have it, you’re just using tools. Maybe faster. But not systematically improving. Each person figures it out independently, makes their own mistakes, develops their own workarounds. Nothing accumulates at the org level.



**The tell:** Fast companies can answer specific questions about their AI-augmented workflows. “Our review queue depth dropped from X to Y after we implemented Z.” “This spec template produces 85% first-pass acceptance.” “Our exception rate
on contract review is 12% and declining.” Slow companies give vibes. “People are using ChatGPT, seems like it helps.”


###
**Why the gap becomes unbridgeable**



The gap compounds because learning compounds.



It’s not just that fast movers are more productive today. They’re accumulating organizational knowledge about how to work this way — what specs work, what evals catch real problems, what delegation structures scale. Here’s where the prediction gets uncomfortable,
because the usual escape routes don’t work the way you’d hope. You can try to buy it, but the tooling without the organizational muscle is just shelfware. You can try to hire your way out, but the people who’ve built this at scale are scarce — and they tend
to self-select into places that already operate this way. You can try to train your way out, but training takes time, and you’re falling further behind every week you’re not compounding.



Here’s the trap most slow organizations don’t see coming: once AI output volume explodes, you can’t manually QA your way back to quality. The window for building instrumentation is
*before* you scale, not after. Organizations that wait until they have a quality problem discover they needed logging, versioning, and eval infrastructure months ago. Retrofitting auditability into workflows that weren’t built for it is
brutally expensive — and you’re doing it while competitors who started earlier are compounding their lead.



By end of 2026, I expect the difference to show up in observable metrics: cycle time for shipping new products, quality consistency at volume, headcount efficiency on comparable outputs. The fast movers won’t just be ahead — they’ll be operating with infrastructure
the slow movers haven’t built.



**The market outcome:** The slow incumbents become predictable competitors. Not because they’re incompetent — because they’re competing against organizations with systematically better operational learning. A startup with 15 people and good
AI infrastructure outships a department of 150 without it. That gap widens every month the infrastructure delta persists.


###
**The training cliff**



The skills required to thrive in the auditability-first world aren’t the skills most professionals have.



Not “prompt engineering” — that’s commoditized. I’m talking about:



**Specification literacy.** Writing intent precisely enough that it’s testable. Decomposing vague goals into concrete criteria. Anticipating failure modes.



**Eval design.** Building harnesses that measure what you care about. Distinguishing good proxies from bad ones. Catching when evals game themselves.



**Exception judgment.** Making good calls on edge cases under time pressure. Recognizing when automated systems are confidently wrong. Calibrating trust appropriately.



**Delegation architecture.** Breaking work into components that parallelize across agents. Defining handoffs and verification gates. Managing work-in-progress you didn’t personally produce.



These skills don’t exist in most training curricula because the need barely existed two years ago. Organizations that need them in 2026 have to build them while doing their regular jobs, while competitors who started earlier pull further ahead.



The training requirement isn’t “learn new tools.” It’s “become a different kind of professional.” That’s why I expect 2026 skill development needs to exceed the previous five years combined — not as exaggeration, but as structural reality. Previous transitions
added tools to existing job shapes. This one changes the shapes.





##
**Closing**



These three bets — the review stack flipping, work becoming testable, the chasm opening between instrumented organizations and everyone else — aren’t really about AI capabilities. The capability predictions write themselves. These are about what happens when
those capabilities collide with how organizations actually work: the workflow inversions, the identity shifts, the compounding gaps that open up between teams that figure this out and teams that don’t.



I might be wrong about timing, and I might be wrong about magnitude. But the directions look overdetermined — the pieces are visible, the incentives are aligned, and the assembly is already underway at the organizations paying closest attention.



The question is which parts land in your world first, and whether you have the prerequisites when they do.
