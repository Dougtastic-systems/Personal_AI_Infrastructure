AI solved PowerPoint this week, but mostly we slept on it.



Why? Because prompting for powerpoint is THE hardest skill out there in AI.



Harder than for docs. Harder than code. Harder than Excel.




That’s because your prompt has to do at least three jobs at once:




1.
Explain how to tell a story



2.
Set up the data for the story



3.
Explain the visuals



And you have to do all that with an LLM that cannot “see” the way we see. So it’s designing blind. Good luck!



So how did PowerPoint get solved this week?



Honestly, with a lot of token burn. Basically, [
Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://substack.com/redirect/fd0a9325-dc09-4ac2-a5c7-305d64439ff4?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU) revs the engines and goes real hard and checks and re-checks with some obsessive spacing skills (I get into the details in the video).



Is it just Sonnet 4.5 that can do this stuff? Nope. Opus 4.1 is pretty good. And these prompts even help ChatGPT-5. I’m not gonna pretend ChatGPT is my favorite model for PowerPoint, but the principles scale.



And that brings me to the prompts—what have we got in the box here? Put simply I’m looking to build the prompt pack that really saves you days of work a month. I looked it up: we spend about a day a week on average on decks. Some
more, some less (lucky engineers).



Well, we don’t have to anymore! I picked the prompts that take out a massive chunk of that work—and I explain how they work.



You get:


-
A deep-dive video explaining WHY prompting is hard and HOW to make AI prompt PowerPoint right
-
An explanation of the five principles of PowerPoint prompting that will work for ANY AI (not just Claude)—it’s basically a PowerPoint construction system
-
A bad prompt breakdown (yes I’m sharing a failed prompt for the first time!)
-
A good prompt breakdown (how I fixed that prompt)
-
16 production grade PowerPoint prompts
-
4 Foundation Prompts designed to help you teach AI your PowerPoint style
-
12 production prompts for Marketing, Product, Ops, Executive, and the Board
-
Handy tips on the hard stuff: how to work your own designs in, where to chunk work, how to handle longer board decks, how to force prompt fidelity, etc.



Basically you get everything you need to get you and your team going with PowerPoint for AI. And I built it so it’s immediately useful (especially with Claude), but will become
*more* useful as AI deck intelligence scales out.




In a couple of months, everyone will be wrestling with this stuff. And you’re gonna have the answers. This is how to tackle the hardest prompt problem out there.




Jump in, have fun, and enjoy your get out of jail free card for PowerPoint hell!

Grab The Prompts! (6 Packs Below)



Sixteen prompts total—four foundation prompts that handle the mechanics every deck needs (style extraction, style application, complex narrative planning, final validation) and twelve specialized prompts across six business contexts
(Strategic Decision Making, Organizational Alignment, Operational Excellence, Marketing Strategy, Product Strategy). The foundation layer sets up once and works for everything else. Each specialized prompt plugs into that foundation—you extract your style
JSON once, then every deck enforces it automatically, with simple decks working in single-pass generation and complex decks using the architect approach for planning, chunking, and assembly. Start with one specialized prompt for your most frequent deck type,
add others as needed—you’re learning one system with sixteen applications.


###
**[SIMPLIFIED
FOUNDATION PROMPTS](https://substack.com/redirect/c76c0236-31c7-43ea-a924-0ed2f60f1d2b?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)**



These four modular prompts form the base system for enterprise deck generation. The Corporate Style Extractor analyzes an existing PowerPoint and captures your brand fundamentals—colors, fonts, logo placement, margins—as simple JSON.
The Corporate Style Applicator takes that JSON and enforces it across new slides while maintaining accessibility and avoiding the design patterns that break (you know, the border boxes we talked about). The Enterprise Deck Architect handles planning for complex
narratives, taking your messy multi-source inputs and creating the blueprint—story structure, slide count, data requirements, all tailored to your specific audience. Finally, Deck Assembly & Validation reviews everything for narrative flow, data consistency,
readability, and brand compliance, then gives you a concise pass/fail report. Extract style once, apply it everywhere, plan complex decks systematically, validate before you ship.


###
**[STRATEGIC
DECISION MAKING PROMPTS](https://substack.com/redirect/ed98749c-b159-4666-a071-faa75e3f2d95?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)**



These prompts plug into your foundation workflow for high-stakes executive presentations. You extract and reuse your corporate style JSON once, then you have three specialized frameworks ready: Board Deck Generator for governance
decisions, Crisis Management Deck for urgent situations requiring clear options and trade-offs, and Quarterly Business Review Builder for regular executive updates. Each prompt specifies what you need upfront (prerequisites and inputs), gives you the slide
structure, enforces brand consistency through html2pptx and your style JSON, and works for both simple single-pass decks and complex multi-chunk builds using the architect approach. The emphasis throughout is traceable metrics, clear decisions, and actionable
outcomes—because leadership audiences don’t have time for ambiguity.


###
**[ORGANIZATIONAL
ALIGNMENT PROMPTS](https://substack.com/redirect/f8d2566e-d2c8-449d-9aac-f939e54100de?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)**



These frameworks handle the communication decks that keep organizations aligned. Same setup as before—extract your style JSON once, then you have two specialized prompts ready. The All-Hands Communicator creates company-wide updates
that balance transparency with strategic direction and actually engage people instead of putting them to sleep. The Competitive Battle Card Deck generates sales enablement materials with factual competitor analysis and objection handling that stays current.
Both prompts specify prerequisites, inputs, recommended slide structures for different scenarios (because a quarterly all-hands is different from a crisis communication), constraints that enforce brand consistency via html2pptx, and validation steps to ensure
clarity and actionability for your specific audience—whether that’s the entire company or your sales team in the field.


###
**[OPERATIONAL
EXCELLENCE PROMPTS](https://substack.com/redirect/a2950afb-5a84-42fb-9964-f3ba414f94a1?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)**



Operations teams need different deck types, so these prompts focus on turning operational data into executive-ready presentations. Extract your style JSON following the foundation setup, then use two specialized frameworks. Financial
Storyteller converts Excel metrics into clear narrative for decision-making—not just “here are the numbers” but “here’s what the numbers mean and what we should do about it.” Status Report Generator takes project tracking data and creates concise stakeholder
updates with progress, risks, and next steps that executives can actually use. Each prompt includes prerequisites, required inputs, recommended slide structures for common scenarios (monthly financial reviews look different from quarterly deep dives), constraints
that enforce brand consistency and data rigor through html2pptx, and validation for financial accuracy, timeline integrity, and actionable outcomes.


###
**[MARKETING
STRATEGY PROMPTS](https://substack.com/redirect/f104de94-0668-42d3-a1d5-df4f2ebba665?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)**



Marketing needs to prove ROI and justify budgets, so this framework centers on the Campaign Results Reporter prompt. You extract and reuse your corporate style JSON following the foundation setup, then this prompt turns multi-channel
analytics into executive-ready dashboards—ROI analysis, funnel insights, budget variance tracking, optimization recommendations. The guide covers required inputs (because you need actual data, not aspirational metrics), slide structures for both monthly and
quarterly reviews, constraints that enforce brand and data rigor via html2pptx, and audience-specific considerations. A deck for your CMO emphasizes different things than a deck for the board. The goal is translating marketing results into credible strategy
and budget decisions that executives can understand and act on.


###
**[PRODUCT
STRATEGY PROMPTS](https://substack.com/redirect/5c266431-7f6f-44b4-b144-265b07968df6?j=eyJ1IjoiOHIxaDEifQ.bBvEbuUaT64-3FYFS8XubQvPw9CPsnWNsoHgk_rgvzU)**



Product teams need to communicate roadmaps and coordinate launches, so these two prompts handle those specific use cases. Extract your style JSON following the foundation workflow, then you have Product Roadmap Presentation for visualizing
priorities, timelines, resourcing, and success metrics over the next six to twelve months, and Product Launch Presentation for coordinating go-to-market across product, marketing, sales, and customer success. Each prompt specifies prerequisites, required inputs
(because you need real timeline and resource data), slide structures for standard and comprehensive scenarios, constraints that enforce brand and methodological rigor through html2pptx, and validation to ensure realistic timelines, clear customer impact, and
measurable outcomes. The emphasis is on presentations that actually help teams coordinate and make decisions, not just look pretty.







#
The PowerPoint Prompting Operating Manual: Yes, You Can Actually Do This



I solved AI for PowerPoint. Not “it kinda works sometimes” solved—production-ready, enterprise-grade, board-presentation-quality solved. And I’m going to show you exactly how because this matters more than you think.



About one-fifth of knowledge work time goes to PowerPoint. Take a day out of your week, that’s PowerPoint. Forty percent of that day is just design. For a thousand-person company, we’re talking about lifting massive amounts of work
that could go to actual thinking instead of slide formatting. The economics alone justify figuring this out.



But here’s what I actually learned: PowerPoint forces you to confront every AI limitation simultaneously—spatial reasoning, visual execution, data synthesis, narrative coherence. It’s the hardest work primitive in regular corporate
knowledge work, harder than code or Excel or docs. In those domains AI is already fluent. With PowerPoint you still have to hold hands. Once you understand why and design around those limits, the system works reliably at scale.


##
The Five Principles (And Why They Actually Matter)



**1. Workflow enforcement unlocks reliability.** Right now in October 2025, if you’re using Claude for PowerPoint generation, you need to explicitly tell
it to use the html2pptx skill. I wish it wasn’t that hacky. I’ve watched Claude admit it didn’t use html2pptx and that’s why it couldn’t measure pixel overhang correctly, then watched it use the skill and everything work perfectly.



This reveals something fundamental: AI systems are trained to be helpful, so when they hit technical barriers they silently downgrade to easier approaches without telling you. Claude can’t invoke the PowerPoint skill reliably? It’ll
switch to document generation logic and do its best to make it look like what you wanted. You won’t know until you open the file and text is sliding under decorative boxes.



The principle that scales beyond any specific model: you have to discover which tools work, understand how they work, then build prompts that insist on using them. This is systems thinking once to save boatloads of time forever.
(If you’re using ChatGPT or Copilot, you need to figure out their equivalent skills by talking to the system, then enforce the ones that work.)



**2. Simple visual rules scale better than decoration.** Clean typography and spacing produces dramatically more reliable results than fancy borders and
containers. I learned this watching my early attempts create completely unreadable slides—text stacking underneath decorative boxes, black text on navy blue pie charts, ten lines crammed into tiny fonts.



This has profound implications for corporate decks that depend on over-decoration and call it branding. That’s not real branding, and organizations that redesign for cleaner typography are going to run circles around everyone else.
Constraint-based design beats decorative specification because current models can describe what they want to create but execution of complex visual layouts fails in non-obvious ways. Keep the visual medium clean and you allow the model to focus on expressing
sophisticated analysis.



Simple doesn’t mean ugly. The good decks I generated have intentional color palettes, subtle gray outlines that actually work, thoughtful color blocking. They’re better communication tools than the over-designed disasters that fail
accessibility requirements.



**3. Multi-chat architecture enables complex narratives.** Board decks can be forty slides. Try to generate that in one conversation and narrative coherence
degrades—slide 25 contradicts slide 8, style consistency breaks down, the model can’t hold the full story arc while executing individual components.



The solution: separate planning from execution. One architect chat creates the blueprint, generator chats build chunks of five to eight slides each, an assembly chat ensures consistency. This scales to enterprise complexity and unlocks
board-ready crisis decks in hours instead of days.



Why can’t we do it all at once? The visual element consumes tokens faster than text or Excel work. The context window gets eaten much quicker with PowerPoint. I have to plan for that and deliberately chunk my work. (That may change,
but for now it’s true.) This architecture frees you to focus on the human element—the organizational conflicts you’re negotiating, the stakeholder perspectives you’re synthesizing. Most complex narratives involve organizational conflict anyway. You want to
spend your time on that negotiation, not on whether bullet points are properly aligned.



**4. Iterative prompts build faster than comprehensive ones.** I thought comprehensive prompts with multiple validation layers would produce better results.
Wrong. My eight-page prompt that focused entirely on data synthesis and narrative arc produced the disaster deck—text underneath objects, black on black pie charts, contrast ratios that would fail accessibility requirements. The model could pass every validation
step in that prompt and still create something completely unreadable. Which it did.



What works: establish base template, add data, add synthesis logic, then add style requirements, each step validated. On smaller decks you can do this in one prompt by telling the model to validate incrementally. On bigger decks
these become separate prompts. I’ve watched Claude check itself against my outline requirements, fail its own test, and go back to fix it while I drink coffee. Frontier models can self-iterate if you give them the framework.



**5. Explicit synthesis logic handles real enterprise data.** PowerPoints are narratives about conflicts over data. That means you need to tell AI how
to reconcile conflicts, validate sources, and synthesize perspectives. Not “format this CSV” but “reconcile these three conflicting financial projections and explain your methodology.”



Real enterprise data has conflicts, gaps, ambiguities. Prompts that work for clean toy datasets fall apart with actual complexity—not because formatting breaks but because the model needs explicit data processing logic that wasn’t
required before. This is one of the great constraints on AI across enterprise work. Your prompts need to expose the data processing logic that used to live in your head and express your intent clearly about how to resolve the conflicts you know are there.


##
What Actually Changed Between Bad and Good



The bad prompt was eight pages long and obsessed with data synthesis. Creative constraints like “the deck must feel like McKinsey crisis consulting but maintain startup urgency” (what does that even mean visually?), narrative arc
specifications, failure conditions around content. Nothing about visual execution.



The good prompt was much shorter and validated entirely different things. It specified the html2pptx workflow explicitly, banned border boxes and outline shapes and rounded rectangles, asked the model to describe its visual approach
before executing—layout strategy, color palette, typography hierarchy, visual emphasis plan. Then it built in visual validation gates: show thumbnail preview, verify contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 minimum, test readability at different zoom levels, confirm no
overlapping elements. The failure conditions included visual requirements: any bordered text boxes means immediate failure and redesign.



The resulting deck looks dramatically better. Simpler slides that are easier to read, better communication tools, still thoughtful in design. Watching the model work reveals why—it’s brute forcing through iterations, try it, tweak
the header size, try again, adjust spacing, try again. This is hard for AI too. The reason we humans spend half a day per week on PowerPoint design is because it genuinely is difficult work that requires the combination of analysis (dealing with conflicting
data logic) and visual storytelling (getting it into something clean and spatial). That intersection is where current AI capabilities hit their limits.


##
The New Economics



You can now systematically generate enterprise PowerPoint decks reliably, at scale, with quality that passes executive review. The new workflow: you own data and narrative requirements, AI generates deck chunks using proven prompts,
you review and refine. What took three days now takes an hour, maybe twenty minutes if you have the data ready.



Status reports automated. Sales decks templatized with AI customization for each prospect. Board updates become rapid synthesis exercises where you focus on message refinement instead of slide formatting. Crisis briefings generated
on the fly instead of requiring all-nighters. Teams without design resources produce polished decks. Subject matter experts create presentations without PowerPoint skills. You have time to iterate on messaging in ways you never could before.



The new role: deck architect—someone who understands narrative structure, data synthesis, and prompt engineering. They build blueprints, AI executes, organizations scale presentation capacity without proportional headcount.


##
Why This Actually Matters



The principles I’ve laid out scale beyond any specific model. When another system becomes better at PowerPoint generation (and it will), these constraints still apply: workflow enforcement, simple visual rules, multi-chat architecture
for complexity, iterative validation, explicit synthesis logic.



PowerPoint is the hardest work primitive precisely because it combines everything—spatial reasoning, visual execution, analytical synthesis, narrative coherence. Getting it right required understanding where AI’s text capabilities
transfer to structured visual outputs and where they don’t, then building systems that play to strengths and compensate for limits.



Once we get this right, we change how stories are told in business settings. Cleaner PowerPoints, better iteration, humans focusing on storytelling instead of wrestling with alignment and font sizes. The result: enterprise PowerPoint
generation that actually works. Not experimental. Production-ready.



Yes, you can do PowerPoint with AI. This is how to do it right.
