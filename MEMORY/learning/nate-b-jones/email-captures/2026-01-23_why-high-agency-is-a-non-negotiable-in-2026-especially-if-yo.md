Entry-level hiring at major technology companies has collapsed by more than fifty percent since 2019, according to SignalFire’s analysis of new grad hiring at large tech firms. Globally, entry-level job postings—roles requiring zero
to two years of experience—declined sharply through 2024 and into 2025, per Randstad data reported by the World Economic Forum. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates sits at 5.3 percent as of Q3 2025—above the 4.4 percent overall unemployment
rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in December 2025, according to New York Fed and BLS data.



This isn’t a temporary hiring freeze. It’s a fundamental restructuring of how careers work.



The routine tasks that once trained newcomers—summarizing meetings, cleaning data, drafting memos, processing information—are precisely the tasks that generative AI handles with increasing competence. Entry-level jobs today require
experience that entry-level roles no longer supply. AI has cannibalized the low-risk work that used to teach people how to operate in complex organizations. Without those task rungs, the traditional career ladder is being disassembled while people are still
standing on it.



So what do you do when the ladder disappears?



The answer is high agency. Not ordinary high agency—the kind that was always useful, always correlated with success. I mean off-the-charts, paradigm-altering high agency. The distinction matters now in ways it never has before, because
AI is imposing a forcing function on the degree of agency you possess. The gap that once took twenty years to emerge now opens in months.



**Here’s what’s inside:**


-
**The locus of control test.** A simple exercise that reveals whether you’re actually high agency or just think you are—and the four-word response that distinguishes the two.
-
**The objections, addressed directly.** Why this isn’t bootstrap ideology, how it relates to privilege, and the difference between high agency and self-blame.
-
**Why AI changes the calculation.** The research on internal locus of control is extensive, but AI has become the most powerful accelerant for agency in a generation—and I’ll show you exactly
how.
-
**The solo founder proof.** From twenty-four percent of startups in 2019 to thirty-six percent in 2025, plus the specific story of how a small team built an eighty-million-dollar exit in six months
with no venture funding.
-
**The say-do ratio.** The second critical component of high agency that most people get catastrophically wrong.



The people who thrive in the next decade will be those who internalize this framework—not because it’s a nice mindset to have, but because the alternative no longer produces outcomes.

High agency without a system is just motivation—and motivation fades. These prompts exist because the gap between “I should do this” and “I did this” is where most ambition dies.




Gate checks prevent AI from guessing when you haven’t given it enough context, which means you can’t outsource clarity you don’t have. The “consumable artifact” constraint stops you from producing notes and frameworks that feel like
progress but never leave your laptop. The forced distribution question—”who will see it today?”—is the say-do ratio made operational: you don’t get to claim you shipped if no one saw it. The anti-planning guardrail catches the moment when research becomes
procrastination dressed up as preparation.



These aren’t templates to fill in; they’re constraints that make avoidance expensive and action cheap. The old ladder gave you assignments, deadlines, and someone waiting for your work. These prompts recreate that structure—except
now you own it. That’s what internal locus of control actually looks like: not a belief that you can do anything, but a system that turns belief into proof.


##
What high agency actually means



Let me define what I mean, because most people get this wrong. High agency is not a feeling. It’s not a sense of empowerment or confidence. Interrogating your own emotions about whether you feel empowered leads you in circles and
produces nothing useful. High agency is better understood through a concept that psychologist Julian Rotter identified in the 1950s: locus of control.



Here’s a simple exercise that reveals where you actually stand. Draw a circle on a piece of paper. Write down all the major elements in your life that matter to you: family, friends, business, projects, education, your next promotion,
goals you’ve set. Whatever falls inside the circle is what you perceive as under your control. Whatever falls outside the circle is what you perceive as beyond your influence.



When people with lower agency do this exercise, more of the significant elements in their lives end up outside the circle. The next promotion? Outside—that’s up to my manager. The degree of learning required to get somewhere? Outside—I
don’t have time. Major life changes? Outside—the economy, the job market, circumstances beyond my control. For people with genuinely high agency, everything important is inside the circle—not as guaranteed outcomes, but as projects they own. The next promotion,
the compensation, the learning curve, the location, the skill development. Family goals, friendship goals, career goals, professional goals, AI goals. All inside—as strategy, as effort, as response.



If your reaction to this is “that’s impossible—some things are genuinely outside my control,” then you’ve identified the precise mindset that distinguishes people who are high agency from those who are not. When high-agency people
hear that voice inside suggesting something is beyond their control, they respond with four words: “It’s a skill issue.”



It’s a skill issue. I just don’t know how to do it yet. I can learn. Maybe I don’t know how to get that promotion right now, but I can figure out what’s blocking me and address it. Maybe I don’t have the technical skills for that
role, but I can acquire them. Maybe the obstacle seems immovable, but I haven’t yet found the right angle of attack.








**Common objections to the high-agency framing**



Now, I can already hear the objections. And some of them are legitimate, so let me address them directly.



“This is just bootstrap ideology. You’re telling people to hustle their way out of systemic problems.” I’m not asking you to Pollyanna your way through life. Of course you don’t actually make the decision when your company lets you
go. Of course there are economic forces, industry shifts, and structural barriers that exist independent of your mindset. The point isn’t that you control whether the layoff happens. The point is that having the mindset that you can get through it—that your
next step is within your control—is both realistic and statistically correlated with better outcomes. You control how you respond. You control what you learn next. You control where you direct your energy.



“This ignores privilege. Easy to talk about high agency when you have savings, education, and no caregiving responsibilities.” Here’s what I’ve observed: people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds who succeed tend to have
even higher agency than average. Not because the deck is fair—it isn’t. Not because structural barriers don’t exist—they do. But because when you have less margin for error, when you can’t fall back on family money or professional networks, the behavior trait
of high agency becomes even more essential. I’m not saying the world is stacked fairly. I’m saying the trait scales. It matters for everyone, and it may matter even more when you’re starting with less.



“Internal locus of control can become self-blame. If I believe I control everything and then fail, I’ll just beat myself up.” This is a real risk, and I want to name it. The ask here isn’t to blame yourself for every setback. The
ask is to channel that internal orientation into challenge—into the opportunity to learn, to adapt, to find the angle of attack you haven’t tried yet. There’s a difference between “I failed because I’m inadequate” and “I haven’t figured this out yet, but I
can.” The first is self-destruction. The second is high agency.



“What about survivorship bias? You’re going to show me solo founders who made millions, but what about the ninety-five percent who failed?” Fair point. The world is too big for every outcome in the distribution to fit inside a single
argument. But the statistical relationship between internal locus of control and positive life outcomes is one of the most replicated findings in organizational psychology. Not everyone with high agency becomes a millionaire. But overwhelmingly, people who
are higher agency have better career trajectories, more resilience, and more satisfaction—even if the destination isn’t a yacht in Dubai.








And here’s the piece that changes the calculation entirely: AI has become the most powerful accelerant for agency in a generation. I’ve watched people in the last year go from living in their parents’ basement, from dead-end jobs,
from situations that looked hopeless—to running their own businesses. Not because they got lucky. Because they took a high-agency mindset, used AI to learn what they didn’t know, and then relentlessly executed. The barriers that used to require years of expensive
education or access to the right networks can now be overcome by someone with a laptop and the determination to figure it out. AI doesn’t care about your pedigree. It responds to your questions. If you’re willing to ask and willing to act on what you learn,
you have access to capability that was genuinely unavailable five years ago.







##
**The mechanism: how AI broke the training ladder**



This matters now more than it ever has because of what AI actually did to the traditional career path. The mechanism is simple but brutal: AI doesn’t “take jobs” in the way headlines suggest. It removes the low-risk repetitions that
used to build competence and trust.



Entry-level work was never just about getting tasks done. It was about learning how organizations function—how decisions get made, how communication flows, how quality gets maintained. You earned trust by handling small things well,
and that trust unlocked bigger things. The tasks themselves were training wheels.



AI handles those tasks now. Not perfectly, but well enough that organizations no longer need humans to do them at volume. And without those reps, without that low-stakes proving ground, organizations face a gap: they need experienced
people, but they’ve eliminated the mechanism that produces experience. The result is job postings that demand three years of experience for roles that used to train you from zero.



This is the ladder being disassembled. Not because AI replaced workers directly, but because it removed the rungs that workers used to climb.







##
**The forcing function: why the gap opens in months, not decades**



Before this moment in technological history, whether you had high agency or not was something that sorted itself out over the course of decades. It was not easy to tell on a day-to-day basis. People with high agency and people with
low agency eventually diverged, but the process was slow, the signal gradual. You could coast for a while. You could wait for the next rung to appear. That world is gone.



Because AI acts as such a powerful accelerant, people with high agency are now able to accomplish dramatically more than people with low agency—not incrementally more, but orders of magnitude more. The gap that once took twenty years
to emerge now opens in months. Career trajectories that would have been impossible in the 2010s are now happening routinely for those who understand this shift. And the inverse is equally true: career stagnation that would have taken a decade to become apparent
now manifests in a year or two.



The tempo changed. AI creates immediate feedback loops. You can test an idea today, ship it tomorrow, measure results by next week. For high-agency people, this is a gift—they iterate faster, compound faster, learn faster. For low-agency
people, it’s exposure—the gap between them and their high-agency peers becomes visible almost immediately, because the high-agency peers are shipping while they’re still planning.



The people who are being asked to take senior leadership roles now are those with existing senior leadership experience plus AI-native thinking and working methods. There’s an extra demand on everyone at every level. The work that
would have been sufficient for a promotion in 2015 is no longer enough. The people with extremely high agency who can demonstrate the AI-native way of thinking while also showing their accomplishments at scale are the ones getting those roles. They’re being
chosen partly because they are the ones who will redefine what those roles mean.



Organizations recognize they must generate extraordinary value from their AI investments. When you look at an org structure today, instead of viewing it as a stable thing, it’s more accurate to view it as malleable—liable to change
shortly, because it will. As compute has scaled and intelligence has scaled, organizations have been disrupted. They are reorganizing centers of ownership to take full advantage of the intelligence now available to them. This doesn’t always mean cutting people;
sometimes it does. But it always means expecting different patterns of responsibility to emerge.



One non-obvious consequence of all this: job titles are becoming increasingly meaningless on both ends of the spectrum. The low-agency and high-agency alike are rendering traditional credentials irrelevant, but in opposite ways.
Those with low agency tend to cling to titles as markers of status and progress. They want the promotion, the new business card, the LinkedIn update. Those with high agency couldn’t care less. They understand that the title is just a label, that the org chart
is just a diagram, and that what matters is the capacity to generate outcomes. The title will follow the outcomes, not the other way around.



So if your career path exists in a world this changeable, the only real option is to be high agency. There is no alternative. The passive approach of waiting for the next rung on the ladder to appear no longer works when the ladder
itself is being disassembled. If you want to drive your career path, reach your goals, and consistently deliver results, there is only one viable strategy now: high agency combined with AI fluency.







##
**The research: what locus of control actually predicts**



The research on locus of control is extensive and remarkably consistent. Meta-analyses in organizational psychology—notably Ng et al. (2006) and Wang et al. (2010)—link internal locus of control with greater persistence when facing
challenges, higher academic achievement, better professional outcomes, more effective leadership, and stronger entrepreneurial activity. Companies led by CEOs with an internal locus of control are more likely to survive difficult periods. Groups led by individuals
with an internal locus perform better than those led by individuals with an external locus.



This isn’t about delusion or ignoring reality. High-agency people don’t pretend that obstacles don’t exist or that the world is fair. They recognize that there is an uncertain number of obstacles between them and any significant
goal, and they maintain an irrationally confident belief that those obstacles can be overcome with the resources they have within themselves. Yes, maybe learning about LLMs isn’t enough to get hired at a major AI lab. But the high-agency mindset says: I’ll
figure out what the additional obstacles are, I’ll knock them down one by one, and I’ll get there. The path is uncertain, but the destination is controllable.



Kobe Bryant embodied this framing in a way that’s worth studying. The idea attributed to him: if you’re nervous before a big game, that’s just your body telling you that you didn’t prepare enough. Think about that framing. Most people
interpret nervousness as an emotional state that happens to them, something to be managed or suppressed. The Kobe framing interprets it as information—specifically, information about a gap in preparation that can be addressed. He decided as a kid that he was
going to become the best basketball player in the world, dedicated his entire life to that goal, and became phenomenal. When nervous, he didn’t try to calm himself down. He went back and prepared more. Everything was controllable. Everything could be addressed
through preparation and effort.







##
**The say-do ratio**



The second critical component of high agency is what might be called the say-do ratio. If you say you’re going to do something, you do it. Not tomorrow. Not after making a plan. Not after talking about it. You go and do it. Now.



This sounds simple, but most people have a terrible say-do ratio. They say they’re going to learn a new skill, and then they research courses for three weeks. They say they’re going to start a side project, and then they spend a
month choosing the perfect tech stack. They say they’re going to get in shape, and then they spend their evenings reading about optimal workout routines instead of working out. The gap between intention and action stretches into weeks, months, years.



There is extraordinary progress available in life when you collapse the distance between saying you’ll do something and actually doing it. This often means starting when it feels uncomfortable. It means beginning the work before
you feel ready. It means shipping halfway done rather than waiting for perfection that never arrives. It means accepting that the first version will be rough, and that rough is infinitely better than theoretical.



This is particularly relevant for New Year’s resolutions and big commitments. People make large goals and assume that commitment alone will carry them forward. But a high say-do ratio means committing to the specific skill, identifying
how you’re going to develop it, and then doing the work today, even if it’s uncomfortable. Even if it’s halfway done. Even if you’re not sure it’s the right approach. You keep going. You iterate. You learn by doing rather than by planning to do.

**The doctrine: what high-agency AI use actually looks like**



Here’s something rarely discussed: if you approach life with high agency, your approach to AI automatically becomes dramatically better. The breathless newspaper articles about students using AI as an answer engine, struggling with
literacy and critical thinking, losing IQ points from AI exposure—those outcomes only happen to people who are passive. They only happen to people who lack agency. If you are high agency, if you’re aspirational, if you want to achieve something, you can engage
with AI in a way that drives what you want out of it.



The passive approach treats AI as something that happens to you. You type a question, you get an answer, you accept it uncritically or reject it reflexively. The high-agency approach treats AI as an extension of your own capacity:



You use it to define your next action, not just answer your question. You use it to test ideas rapidly—prototype, ship, measure—rather than research endlessly. You use it to patch gaps in your knowledge while building, rather than
waiting until you’ve mastered everything theoretically. You use it to explore problems more deeply than you could alone. You use it to learn skills faster. You use it to generate analyses that would have required a team.



The difference isn’t what tool you use. It’s whether you’re driving or being driven.

**The proof: solo founders and the new math**



This is exactly what we see in the emergence of solo founders building million-dollar and multi-million-dollar businesses. According to Carta data, the share of startups with solo founders rose from 23.7 percent in 2019 to 36.3 percent
in the first half of 2025. Solo founders now account for more than a third of the startup class. These aren’t lifestyle businesses or small consultancies—they’re serious ventures that challenge how entire industries operate.



Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicts the first one-person billion-dollar company could emerge as early as 2026. Sam Altman has publicly predicted the same milestone will arrive in the next few years. The question itself underscores
a new reality: billion-dollar companies are evolving to become leaner and faster. AI unicorns reached billion-dollar valuations in just two years with around two hundred employees, while non-AI unicorns typically required nine years and nearly double the team
size.



Consider Maor Shlomo, who built Base44 from a personal side project to an acquisition by Wix for approximately eighty million dollars in six months. No venture funding. A small team—reportedly around eight people—but Shlomo as the
primary builder, pushing to production thirteen times a day in the early weeks. By May 2025, the company was generating $189,000 in monthly profit. A tiny team, leveraging AI to accomplish what would have previously required a much larger organization.



This is what high agency plus AI looks like in practice. The founders succeeding in this environment view AI correctly: as the ingredient that transforms previous skill blockers into strengths. Maybe they don’t know JavaScript. Now
they can know JavaScript and just build with it. Maybe they’ve never done marketing. Now they can generate and test marketing approaches at scale. AI extends their brain. AI patches their skill gaps. AI enables them to deliver value into the world at a scale
that was previously impossible for small teams.



The pattern isn’t limited to tech founders. The same dynamic applies to anyone trying to accomplish ambitious goals. A product manager who uses AI to prototype features before engineering resources are available. A writer who uses
AI to research and organize complex topics in a fraction of the previous time. A consultant who uses AI to generate analyses that would have required a team. The common thread is treating AI as an extension of agency rather than a replacement for thinking.







##
**The animating purpose: value creation**



The animating purpose behind all of this is value creation. People who are high agency are obsessed with pushing value into the world. They know that if the value they generate is high enough, it will come back to them. Every single
person I’ve met who operates at an extremely high-agency level has this mindset. They think constantly about how to push more value out, how to contribute more, how to create more.



The specific form varies by talent set. Athletes think about being the best they can be at their sport. Product people think about what they can ship. Engineers think about what they can invent. Writers think about what ideas they
can clarify and spread. But the common thread is a fundamental belief that they can create, that they can push value out, and that the world will respond to that value. This doesn’t mean they neglect business models or aren’t thoughtful about monetization.
But their primary orientation is toward contribution rather than extraction.



High-agency people believe that the world is surprisingly bendable. It will bend in the direction they want it to go if they push enough value out and invest enough in expanding their locus of control. This isn’t magical thinking—it’s
a strategic disposition toward life that has been validated by decades of psychological research and is now being amplified by the availability of AI tools. The person who ships ten projects learns more than the person who plans one project perfectly. The
person who creates value for others builds relationships and opportunities that the person waiting for permission never accesses.

**What to do now**



Instead of viewing any of this as a self-help checklist—”do these six things and magically transform”—consider it as an unprecedented opportunity for an entire generation to become high agency when they might not have otherwise.
AI enables you to speed-run all the pieces that would normally be blockers.



Before AI, if you wanted to be a solo founder but couldn’t code, it was a massive obstacle. Yes, it was a skill issue, and yes, you could theoretically get through it, but it required an enormous investment of time—years of learning
before you could build anything substantial. Now you can move through that obstacle in weeks or months. You can build functional prototypes while learning, rather than learning for years before building. The same applies to marketing, to content creation,
to data analysis, to customer service automation, to financial modeling, to design. The barriers that used to require years of specialization can now be addressed rapidly by someone with high agency and AI fluency.



The challenge, then, is to look at AI as the most powerful accelerant for agency that has ever been created. Ask yourself: if I want to become truly high agency, where do I need to apply this lever to expand my locus of control and
accomplish my goals?



Start with something specific. Identify a goal that you would traditionally perceive as outside your control—your next promotion, a business you want to start, a skill you think is beyond your reach, a project that seems too ambitious.
Ask yourself what it would take to bring that goal inside your locus of control. What would you need to learn? What would you need to build? What obstacles would you need to overcome? Then use AI to map the path and accelerate through it.



Have an honest conversation with yourself: I have this goal. I would normally perceive it as uncontrollable—something that depends on luck, on other people’s decisions, on circumstances beyond my influence. I’m going to own it now.
What does completely owning this look like? What would a person with an extremely high internal locus of control do in my situation? And then do that thing. Today. Not after more research. Not after the perfect plan emerges. Today.



The traditional entry points are being automated. The traditional progression paths are being compressed. The traditional relationship between credentials and opportunities is being severed.



What remains is agency. What remains is the belief that you control your outcomes, combined with the tools to actually exercise that control at unprecedented scale. What remains is the willingness to collapse the distance between
intention and action, to start when it’s uncomfortable, to push value into the world and trust that it will return.



The career ladder as it existed is gone. But something potentially more powerful has emerged in its place: a direct link between individual agency, intelligent tools, and the ability to create value at scale. The people who see this
clearly are already moving. They’re building, shipping, learning, iterating. They’re not waiting for permission or for the old structures to return.



The future belongs to those who understand this and act on it. Not eventually. Not after making a plan. Now.
