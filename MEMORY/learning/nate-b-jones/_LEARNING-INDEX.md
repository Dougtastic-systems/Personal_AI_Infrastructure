**Purpose:** Deep learning from Nate B Jones content with intentional practice
**Started:** 2026-01-09

## Content Library

| Date | Title | Key Concept | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-09 | Second Brain 2026 | AI-powered capture → classify → surface loop | To Review |
| 2026-01-09 | CES 2026 AI Strategies | Inference economics, industrial AI | To Review |
| 2026-01-09 | Ralph Wiggum / Pretty Good | Evaluation as steering wheel, not grade | To Review |
| 2026-01-09 | Manus Acquisition | Finishing > Starting, goal re-articulation | To Review |

## Extracted Patterns

### 1. The Completion Problem
- Models say "done" prematurely
- Solution: Continuous evaluation, not end-state grading
- Implementation: Stop hooks, binary success criteria

### 2. The Second Brain Architecture
- Capture (zero decisions) → Classify (AI routes) → Store (simple DBs) → Surface (proactive nudges)
- Key: Human does ONE thing, system does rest

### 3. Inference Economics
- $/token is the new metric
- Inference > Training in operational reality
- Optimize for serving, not just capability

### 4. Agentic Persistence
- File system as external memory
- Goal re-articulation for long tasks
- Restorable compression (drop from context, recover)

## Cross-Cutting Themes

1. **Reduce human cognitive load** - Systems should work while you sleep
2. **Binary success criteria** - "Done" must be measurable
3. **Build for restart** - Assume failure, make recovery easy
4. **Evaluation is control** - Don't let models self-assess completion

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
- [x] Build Ralph-style completion hook for PAI ✅ 2026-01-09
- [ ] Define binary "done" criteria template

### Near-Term (This Month)
- [ ] Design second brain capture flow for PAI
- [ ] Implement goal re-articulation for complex tasks

### Exploration (When Ready)
- [ ] Study Manus architecture deeper
- [ ] Build cost tracking for inference economics
