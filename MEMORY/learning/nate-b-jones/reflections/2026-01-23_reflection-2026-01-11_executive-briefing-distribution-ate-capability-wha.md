## Key Concepts Extracted

**Distribution Over Capability**: The deal reveals that market success depends more on distribution channels and go-to-market reach than on raw AI/technical capability, challenging conventional competitive wisdom.
**Bifurcated AI Market**: The AI industry is splitting into distinct segments—likely separating companies with superior distribution from those with superior technology—requiring different strategies.
**Enterprise Consolidation Pattern**: Strategic partnerships between AI capability builders (Cognition) and distribution powerhouses (Infosys) indicate a market shift toward vertical integration rather than standalone competition.
**Conventional Narrative Risk**: Prevailing beliefs about AI competition are driving investment decisions that may prove strategically misaligned with actual market outcomes.
**Capability-Market Mismatch**: Superior technical capability alone is insufficient for business success without accompanying distribution infrastructure and market access channels.
**Note**: The full content preview is limited, so these concepts are inferred from the headline thesis ("Distribution Ate Capability") and subheading warning. A complete analysis would require reviewing the full article body, quotes, and supporting arguments to validate and refine these conceptual framings.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. In your organization, where have you witnessed "distribution" (market access, partnerships, go-to-market strategy) compensate for inferior capabilities—and conversely, where has superior capability failed due to poor distribution? What does this reveal about where you should actually be investing?

*[Your response]*

### 2. You likely believe your competitive advantage lies in what you build or know. Given this deal's premise that distribution networks matter more than raw capability, what core assumption about your business model might be dangerously outdated, and how would you test whether you're optimizing for the wrong variable?

*[Your response]*

### 3. If you accepted that distribution now "eats" capability, what's the first structural change you'd need to make in how your team is organized, incentivized, or partnered—and what would you need to stop doing to fund it?

*[Your response]*
