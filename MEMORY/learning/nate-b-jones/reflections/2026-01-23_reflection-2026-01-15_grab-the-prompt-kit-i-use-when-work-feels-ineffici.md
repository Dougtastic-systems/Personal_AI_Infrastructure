## Key Concepts Extracted

**AI Native Mindset**: Going beyond faster execution to fundamentally redesign how work processes are structured and approached with AI capabilities.
**Efficiency vs. Busyness**: Distinguishing between genuine productivity and mere activity, identifying bottlenecks that create the illusion of progress without real output.
**Prompt Kit Framework**: A reusable collection of prompts tailored to specific workflow problems, enabling systematic diagnosis and resolution of inefficiency patterns.
**Bottleneck Experimentation**: Testing targeted interventions at points of friction in workflows to measure impact and identify which unlearned habits unlock the most value.
**Habits Worth Unlearning**: Examining counterproductive work patterns and assumptions that prevent effective AI integration, requiring conscious behavioral shifts rather than tool adoption alone.
**Note**: The newsletter preview is incomplete, limiting depth of analysis. For fuller insights, I'd recommend reviewing: the core thesis section, specific habit recommendations, the prompt kit contents, and suggested experiments linked in the full piece.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. When you describe your work as "inefficient but busy," what specific moments reveal the gap between activity and progress—and what assumption about productivity are you protecting by staying in that pattern?

*[Your response]*

### 2. The newsletter suggests "AI native" requires unlearning habits rather than just working faster; which of your current workflows would fundamentally break if you removed the speed constraint and redesigned them from first principles?

*[Your response]*

### 3. If you implemented one prompt-based experiment this week to address your biggest bottleneck, what would need to change about how you measure success—and what would you have to stop measuring instead?

*[Your response]*
