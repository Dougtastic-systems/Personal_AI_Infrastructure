## Key Concepts Extracted

**Specification Gap**: The disconnect between AI output that appears polished but contains fundamental errors due to unclear or incomplete requirements definitions.
**Correctness Definition Requirement**: Understanding whether your use case demands precise, measurable correctness criteria determines which AI tool (Codex vs. Claude Code) will perform better.
**Tool-Shaped vs. Colleague-Shaped AI**: Different AI systems excel in different contexts—some work better with explicit specifications, others with iterative collaboration and ambiguity.
**Prompt Kit Solutions**: Practical frameworks and templates designed to help users identify and close gaps between what their AI produces and what they actually need.
**Context-Aware Tool Selection**: Success with AI depends on first diagnosing your situation's characteristics (definable vs. undefined correctness) before choosing implementation approaches.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. When you've received impressive-looking AI output that later proved flawed, what was the gap between what you asked for and what you actually needed—and how could you have specified the problem differently upfront?

*[Your response]*

### 2. You likely default to one tool or approach for AI work; what assumption are you making about when that tool is "good enough," and how might that assumption be costing you in situations where a different approach would serve you better?

*[Your response]*

### 3. In your next project, before prompting an AI, can you write down what "correct" looks like in concrete, measurable terms—and what would change about how you evaluate the output if you had to defend that definition to someone else?

*[Your response]*
