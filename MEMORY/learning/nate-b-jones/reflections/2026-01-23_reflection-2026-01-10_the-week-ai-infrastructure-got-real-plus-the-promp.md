## Reflection Questions

### 1. When you think about AI infrastructure becoming "real" in your own work or industry, what legacy systems or processes are you still clinging to that assume AI won't fundamentally change how you operate—and what would you need to see happen to actually reorganize around AI-first assumptions?

*[Your response]*

### 2. The newsletter implies a race between major players (NVIDIA, Google, Meta)—but what does "winning" at AI infrastructure actually mean for someone not at that scale, and are you optimizing for the same metrics they are, or should you be playing a different game entirely?

*[Your response]*

### 3. If you had to redesign one critical workflow in your organization around the assumption that AI infrastructure will be radically cheaper and faster 12 months from now, what would break first in your current setup, and what's stopping you from making that change today?

*[Your response]*
