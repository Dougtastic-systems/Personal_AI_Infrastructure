## Key Concepts Extracted

**Unreliable Self-Narration**: Humans naturally distort their own narratives through bias, creating an inaccurate internal story that drives decisions without proper scrutiny.
**Governance Through Perspective**: Implementing structured feedback mechanisms (like traditional councils/boards) provides external viewpoints that counterbalance individual blind spots and improve decision-making.
**AI-Democratized Counsel**: Advanced AI makes accessible the kind of advisory perspective that was historically a luxury for leaders, enabling real-time external validation at scale.
**Accountability Architecture**: Building formal systems to question and validate your own thinking prevents unchecked bias from compounding into poor outcomes.
**Perspective as Infrastructure**: Rather than treating feedback as occasional, treating diverse viewpoints as core infrastructure changes how reliably decisions get made.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. **Personal Narrative**: When you've made a significant decision recently, what blind spots did you only discover afterward—and how might you have accessed that perspective *before* acting if you had a structured "governance mechanism" (trusted advisors, systematic review process, or decision framework)?

*[Your response]*

### 2. **Assumption Challenge**: You likely assume you see your own work/decisions clearly. What would it cost you to operate as if that assumption is false, and what single "perspective mechanism" could you implement this week to test whether outside input actually changes your conclusions?

*[Your response]*

### 3. **Implementation Reality**: The newsletter suggests AI makes accessible perspective cheaper than ever. Rather than gathering more perspectives passively, what specific recurring decision or belief would you be willing to actively pressure-test with a structured system (human or AI-powered), and what would "winning" at that look like?

*[Your response]*
