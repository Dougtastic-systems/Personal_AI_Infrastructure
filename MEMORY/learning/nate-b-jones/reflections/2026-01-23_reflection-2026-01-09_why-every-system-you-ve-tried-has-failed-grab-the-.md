## Reflection Questions

### 1. **What specific system have you abandoned in the past year, and what would need to be different about HOW you implement it—rather than WHAT the system is—for you to actually stick with it this time?**

*[Your response]*

### 2. **You likely have multiple "second brains" scattered across tools (notes, emails, bookmarks, chat histories)—what assumption are you making about consolidation that might actually be keeping you fragmented rather than freeing you?**

*[Your response]*

### 3. **If you could only implement ONE change to your current workflow in the next 90 days, which gap between "what you capture" and "what you actually use" would be most worth closing, and how would you measure whether it's working?**

*[Your response]*
