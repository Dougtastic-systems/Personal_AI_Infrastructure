## Key Concepts Extracted

**Disposable Software Architecture**: Software designed for short-term utility that can be quickly replaced or deprecated rather than maintained long-term, currently viable for well-resourced teams like Cursor but risky for most organizations.
**Reliability Playbook Framework**: A structured approach to building resilient systems that applies practical reliability principles suited to different organizational contexts and constraints.
**Context-Dependent Development Strategy**: Different software paradigms work for different teams based on resources, scale, and risk tolerance—one-size-fits-all approaches fail in the modern era.
**AI-Era Software Sustainability**: The shift toward ephemeral, AI-assisted code creation raises questions about maintainability, technical debt, and long-term system stability across the industry.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. What systems in your current work do you treat as "permanent" that might actually benefit from being rebuilt from scratch every 6-12 months—and what fear or assumption is keeping you from experimenting with that disposability?

*[Your response]*

### 2. If you don't have Cursor's resources or use case, what's the minimum viable reliability threshold your software actually needs, and how much technical debt are you carrying trying to meet a higher standard than your users require?

*[Your response]*

### 3. Where could you introduce intentional friction or constraints into your development process that would force prioritization—essentially choosing disposable components strategically rather than defaulting to either "always maintain" or "always rebuild"?

*[Your response]*
