## Key Concepts Extracted

**Capability Saturation Problem**: When AI model raw capability becomes sufficiently advanced, performance improvements shift from technical optimization to other limiting factors.
**Identity-Driven Throughput**: Personal or organizational identity transformation enables sustained productivity gains that outlast technical skill improvements alone.
**Post-Prompting Optimization**: As prompting techniques plateau in effectiveness, success requires moving beyond prompt engineering toward systemic and behavioral changes.
**Builder-First Strategy**: A 2026-focused framework designed specifically for developers/creators who need to adapt workflows when traditional AI skill scaling hits diminishing returns.
**Stickiness & Persistence**: Implementing changes that create lasting behavioral or operational habits, rather than one-time tactical improvements that fade over time.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. **What identity have you been holding as a builder or creator, and how might shifting from "someone who needs better tools" to "someone who needs better systems/processes" change which problems you actually try to solve?**

*[Your response]*

### 2. **You likely assume that capability gaps (skill, knowledge, model performance) are your primary constraint—what evidence would convince you that your real bottleneck is actually how you've structured your thinking or workflow, and how would you test that hypothesis in the next week?**

*[Your response]*

### 3. **If throughput isn't unlocked by optimizing individual outputs but by changing who you are as an operator, what specific daily habits or identity markers would you need to adopt differently starting tomorrow to make that shift stick beyond the initial enthusiasm?**

*[Your response]*
