## Key Concepts Extracted

**AI Literacy Filtering**: Companies using AI adoption as a screening mechanism to identify employees who can adapt to technology-driven workflows, rather than purely for productivity gains.
**Leverage vs. Usage Gap**: Most organizations struggle to distinguish between merely *using* AI tools and actually *leveraging* them strategically for competitive advantage.
**Duolingo-Shopify Divergence**: Different outcomes from AI implementation—one company failed to extract value while another succeeded, highlighting the importance of strategic deployment over tool adoption alone.
**Job Market AI Demand**: AI literacy requirements in job postings have doubled annually, signaling that AI competency is becoming a core professional baseline expectation.
**AI Leverage Audit Framework**: A systematic assessment tool designed to evaluate whether organizations are achieving meaningful returns from AI investments rather than just adopting tools.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. **Personal Experience**: When you've implemented AI tools in your work or organization, were you optimizing for visible productivity metrics (time saved, tasks completed) or for something less tangible like decision quality and filtering capability—and how did that choice affect your actual outcomes?

*[Your response]*

### 2. **Assumption Challenge**: You likely believe that more AI adoption signals competitive advantage, but what if the real differentiator is *selectivity* in where you apply AI? Which parts of your current role might actually be weakened by automation rather than strengthened?

*[Your response]*

### 3. **Implementation Action**: Drawing from Shopify's "filter" approach versus Duolingo's apparent misstep, what's one decision-making process or workflow in your sphere where AI could help you eliminate poor options rather than just speed up execution—and how would you measure whether that's actually working?

*[Your response]*
