## Key Concepts Extracted

**High Agency**: The ability to independently identify opportunities, take initiative, and create your own path forward rather than waiting for traditional career progression structures.
**Entry-Level Hiring Collapse**: A 50%+ decline in new graduate hiring at major tech firms since 2019, eliminating the traditional first rung of career ladders.
**Self-Directed Career Building**: Using targeted prompts and frameworks to deliberately construct your own advancement strategy when conventional ladder structures no longer exist.
**Proactive Opportunity Creation**: Moving from passive job-seeking to actively building skills, networks, and visible work that attracts opportunities rather than waiting for them.
**Structural Career Disruption**: The breakdown of predictable entry-to-mid-level career pathways, requiring individuals to navigate non-linear advancement independently.
**Actionable Takeaway**: For entry-level professionals in 2026, passive resume-building is insufficient. Success requires demonstrating high agency through self-initiated projects, visibility, and strategic skill development—essentially becoming the architect of your own career rather than waiting for institutional pathways.

### 3. When you encounter a problem or gap in your organization, do you typically wait to be assigned a solution, or do you instinctively map out what *you could do* within your sphere of control—and if it's the former, what's one recurring issue you could reframe as your personal project to solve?
