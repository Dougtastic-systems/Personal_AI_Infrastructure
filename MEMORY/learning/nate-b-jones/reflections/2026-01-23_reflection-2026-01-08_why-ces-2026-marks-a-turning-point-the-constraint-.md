## Key Concepts Extracted

**Allocation Era Transition**: The competitive advantage has shifted from chip manufacturing capability to production allocation and factory economics, determining which companies can actually deliver products to market.
**Factory Economics Primacy**: Physical manufacturing constraints and supply chain logistics now serve as the primary bottleneck and differentiator, rather than technological innovation or design capability.
**Constraint-Based Competition**: Success depends on understanding and navigating underlying resource limitations and production constraints rather than focusing solely on product features or performance metrics.
**Shipping Over Specs**: The ability to physically distribute and deliver products has become more strategically important than raw technical specifications or computational power.
**Market Access Gatekeeping**: Factory capacity and allocation decisions function as the new market entry barrier, effectively determining which companies and products reach consumers.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. In your own work or organization, where are you currently competing on innovation/features when the real constraint is actually manufacturing capacity or resource allocation—and what would change if you reframed your strategy around that bottleneck instead?

*[Your response]*

### 2. You likely believe success comes from having the best idea or product—but if CES 2026 proves it's about execution and allocation, what core assumption about your competitive advantage might be dangerously outdated, and how would you test this?

*[Your response]*

### 3. If factory economics and shipping constraints are now the primary game, what specific operational or supply chain decision could you make in the next 30 days that would give you disproportionate advantage over competitors still focused on product features?

*[Your response]*
