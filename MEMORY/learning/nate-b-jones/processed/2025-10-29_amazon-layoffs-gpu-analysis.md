## Core Thesis
Amazon didn't lay off 30,000 people because AI was doing their jobs—they laid off 30,000 people because they needed cash to buy GPUs to catch up in the AI cloud race. The "AI automation" narrative is corporate PR that sounds innovative; the reality is cloud infrastructure economics and competitive pressure from Azure and Google Cloud.

## Key Concepts
- **AWS as Profit Engine**: Amazon retail has terrible margins. AWS growth rate is what Wall Street watches. AWS has decelerated to 18% YoY while Azure and Google Cloud close the gap, powered by AI infrastructure.
- **GPU Cash Crunch**: Nvidia GPUs cost as much as a decent car each. Amazon needs thousands to compete at scale in AI infrastructure but can't let this investment damage AWS margins. Solution: cut salaries elsewhere.
- **The Contradiction**: Media runs two contradictory narratives—"AI is automating jobs at massive scale" AND "AI is a bubble and we're being fooled by hype." Can't have both. If AI is actually automating jobs, it's not a bubble.
- **Demand vs Bubble**: Amazon has 25% GPU shortfall—demand vastly exceeds supply. Customers lined up, can't serve them all due to hardware shortage. That's genuine demand, not a bubble.

## Mental Models
- **Follow the Money, Not PR**: Official story ("AI automation", "efficiency improvements", "strategic realignment") is rarely full truth. Look at financial pressure, competitive dynamics, capital allocation.
- **Where Cuts Land Reveals Truth**: MGM took big hit—if Amazon had AI automation breakthrough, they wouldn't apply it to Hollywood studio first. Cuts land where Amazon can operate leaner without impacting AWS competitive position.
- **Story Determines Response**: If you believe "AI is automating jobs at scale," rational response is panic. If you understand "companies are making infrastructure bets on AI and funding by cutting elsewhere," rational response is understanding where value is being created and positioning for it.

## Predictions/Bets
- **AI Not Yet Eliminating Most Roles**: Technology isn't mature enough for mass automation. Companies positioning for a future that's coming, creating short-term chaos as they reallocate resources.
- **Smart Move is Understanding, Not Panic**: Know what's actually valuable about AI, where it works today vs where it's falling short, how to position to benefit from transition.

## Quotable Lines
> "Amazon didn't fire 30,000 people because robots took their jobs. They fired 30,000 people to free up cash to buy the hardware they need to stay competitive in AI cloud."
> "Pick one. You can't have both [AI automating jobs AND AI is a bubble]."
> "Follow the money, not the PR."
> "It's not a story about AI apocalypse. It's a story about a company that fell behind and is trying to catch up."

- **Action items:**
  1. Apply Tech Layoff News Decoder framework to future AI employment stories
  2. Track AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud AI infrastructure race
  3. Use "follow the money" analysis for AI vendor evaluations
  4. Distinguish "AI positioning investments" from "AI actually working"
