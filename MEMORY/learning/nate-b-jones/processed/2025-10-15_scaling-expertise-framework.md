## Core Thesis
Expertise has only scaled three ways for thousands of years: work more hours, hire people (dilutes expertise), or raise prices (has ceiling). AI enables a fourth way by attacking the translation layer—the documentation bottleneck between knowing something and delivering a professional output. Your expertise is the valuable part; documentation was the constraint. AI removes it.

## Key Concepts
- **Translation Layer Bottleneck**: HVAC contractor diagnoses system in 20 minutes but takes 2.5 hours writing the estimate. The constraint isn't expertise—it's translating expertise into deliverables. This ratio doesn't scale.
- **Four Things AI Needs**: Role (who you are), Audience (who you're writing for), Goal (what you're accomplishing), Constraints (what matters for this specific task), plus your raw expertise in any form.
- **80-20 Threshold**: AI gets you 80% much faster than any other method. Last 20% requires your expertise—and that's exactly where you should spend time. Set up context to get right 80%, then apply judgment to remaining 20%.
- **Context as Multiplier**: Your ability to articulate what you need in structured, templatized forms is your superpower. Better context = better 80% = less rework.

## Mental Models
- **Documentation vs Expertise Compounding**: Expertise compounds every year (pattern recognition, faster decisions). Writing takes same time forever. AI makes documentation compound with your expertise.
- **Expertise Never Changes Hands**: Diagnosis is yours, solution is yours, pricing is yours, relationship is yours, quality control is yours. AI handles paralegal/apprentice work: structure, translation, persuasion, consistency.
- **Domain-Specific Verification Checklist**: Legal (factual accuracy, privilege, jurisdiction rules, strategy). Medical (diagnosis accuracy, treatment appropriateness, drug interactions). Trades (code compliance, safety, pricing accuracy, site-specific conditions).

## Predictions/Bets
- **Competitive Window Finite**: 12 months from now, clients expect this responsiveness and polish as baseline. Early adopters establish workflow while late adopters play catch-up.
- **50x+ Scaling Multiple Coming**: Current AI gets you to 80%. Next year's will get to 85%. Framework stays same—expertise scaling compounds as models improve.
- **Senior Roles are Communication-Heavy**: Principal engineer spending 8 hours writing design doc isn't good use of $300K/year brain. Design thinking is valuable; LaTeX formatting isn't.

## Tools & Products Mentioned
| Tool | Category | Nate's Take |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 27 Domain Prompts | Templates | RFC docs, technical specs, PRDs, design docs, campaign strategy, sales strategy, investor updates, SOAP notes, treatment plans, project proposals, estimates, listings, etc. |
| Voice-to-Prompt Workflow | Method | 5-minute voice memo → 2-minute AI prompt → 8-minute review. 20 min total vs 2.5 hours traditional |
| Four-Part Formula | Structure | Role + Audience + Goal + Constraints + Raw Expertise = professional deliverable |

## Prompts/Resources Included
- **27 Prompts Across Domains**: Tech/Product (5), Go-to-market (6), Finance/Legal (3), Healthcare (3), Built environment (7), Personal services (2)
- **Complete How-To Guide**: 5-step implementation (pick bottleneck, learn context formula, use iteration pattern, know what to verify, start small then scale)
- **Domain-Specific Verification Lists**: What to always check yourself in legal, medical, trades, ecommerce, real estate, engineering

## Quotable Lines
> "AI didn't replace her expertise. The diagnosis is hers. The solution is hers. The pricing is hers. The relationship is hers."
> "Your expertise is worth more than your typing time. Now prove it."
> "The constraint on expertise has never been your knowledge. It's the translation layer."
> "If you can explain your work to a smart intern or new hire, you can explain it to AI."

## Cross-References
- **Related to:** Y variable (documentation = harnessing layer), Three structural shifts (work becomes testable), Prompt lifecycle (context formula = intent formation)
- **Builds on:** 80-20 threshold echoes generate-validate-repair pattern
- **Contradicts:** N/A

## Personal Relevance (Doug-specific)
- **Applies to:** PAI skill system—every skill is essentially a context formula that enables AI to handle the translation layer. Expertise extraction patterns applicable to learning system.
- **Action items:**
  1. Apply four-part formula (role/audience/goal/constraints) to skill trigger design
  2. Build domain-specific verification checklists for PAI's professional workflows
  3. Create voice-to-structured-prompt workflow for rapid skill prototyping
  4. Audit PAI skills for which translation layer bottleneck they address

## Extraction Quality
- **Confidence:** high
- **Gaps:** Full 27 prompts not captured (behind download link); 9-minute video content not detailed; specific iteration pattern examples not included
