## Core Thesis
Three structural shifts will catch people off guard in 2026: (1) AI starts reviewing AI with humans handling exceptions, (2) non-technical work becomes testable with roles becoming "creative QA functions," and (3) the gap between fast-moving and slow organizations becomes unbridgeable due to compounding organizational learning rates.

## Key Concepts
- **Review Stack Inversion**: The topology flips from "humans review everything" to "AI reviews AI, humans handle exceptions." This requires writing testable specifications, not vague intent.
- **Testable Work**: Every role becomes a "creative QA function"—designing criteria systems check against, not personally checking every output. Domain expertise becomes the ability to write tests for judgment.
- **Agent Legibility**: The ability to see what AI systems are doing and why—what did the agent do, why that choice, what changed, can we roll back?
- **Specification Literacy**: Writing intent precisely enough that it's testable. The new bottleneck when review stops being the constraint.
- **Organizational Learning Rate**: The compounding advantage isn't adoption speed—it's building auditability and rollback into organizational DNA.

## Mental Models
- **Review Topology Framework**: When every hour of AI output requires 30 min human review, you're capped at 2-3x productivity. Flip the topology: AI generates → AI reviews → humans handle flagged exceptions.
- **Confidence Tier Segmentation**: High confidence outputs = spot-check sampling. Medium confidence = expedited human review. Low confidence = full attention.
- **Creative QA Pattern**: Marketing becomes brand testing (define specs AI can score against). Ops becomes workflow versioning (versioned, auditable, reversible). Analysis becomes eval design (what checks catch mistakes).

## Predictions/Bets
- **Bet 1 - Review stack flips**: By 2026, the default shifts from blanket human review to sample-plus-exceptions. The new bottleneck is specification, not review.
- **Bet 2 - Work becomes testable**: At frontier companies, most roles become creative QA functions. Job postings start reading like engineering postings (evaluation frameworks, specifications, testing).
- **Bet 3 - Chasm opens**: The gap between fast-moving and everyone else becomes unbridgeable. Top 5-10% vs bottom 50% will operate in different economic realities by year-end.

## Tools & Products Mentioned
| Tool | Category | Nate's Take |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Eval harnesses | Evaluation | Essential for automated review—check outputs against specifications |
| Judge models | Review | Second AI layer that flags inconsistencies |
| Structured outputs | Infrastructure | Constrain model responses to checkable formats |

## Prompts/Resources Included
- **Topology transition assessment**: Evaluates workflow readiness for review inversion
- **Testability diagnostic**: Pressure-tests if workflow can survive the shift
- **Organizational learning rate audit**: Hard questions about compounding advantage

## Quotable Lines
> "If you can't write testable intent, you don't get the benefits—you're still stuck reviewing everything yourself."
> "The status game changes. Today, status comes from producing excellent work. In the new world, status comes from exception handling or system architecture."
> "If you can't write evals, you will be managed by someone who can."

## Cross-References
- **Related to:** Prompt lifecycle (specification as Stage 1), Claude Skills (skills as testable specifications)
- **Builds on:** Intent formation concept from prompt lifecycle
- **Contradicts:** N/A

## Personal Relevance (Doug-specific)
- **Applies to:** PAI system is already built for this shift—skills are testable specifications, memory system provides auditability, hook system enables automated review.
- **Action items:**
  1. Audit PAI skills for "testable intent"—can each skill's success be evaluated automatically?
  2. Build eval harnesses for critical skills
  3. Add confidence tier routing to agent outputs
  4. Ensure all PAI workflows are versioned and auditable
