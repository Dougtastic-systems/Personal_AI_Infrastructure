# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Neutral technical question about file handling

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking two technical questions: (1) requesting a continuation prompt for parser enhancements, and (2) asking how to handle files from previous sessions. This is a straightforward procedural inquiry with no emotional content directed at NeonBrain's performance. The phrasing 'please create' is polite and matter-of-fact. The second question about dropping files from 'yesterday' is curious and exploratory - Dougtastic wants to understand the system's capabilities for handling older files. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or any emotional indicators present. This is purely information-seeking behavior. The tone suggests Dougtastic is engaged with the work and wants to continue productively, but isn't expressing sentiment about NeonBrain's current performance - just asking about next steps and capabilities.
