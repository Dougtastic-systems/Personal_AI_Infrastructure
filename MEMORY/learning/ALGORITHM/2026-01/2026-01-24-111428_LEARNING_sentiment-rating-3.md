# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated that NeonBrain misunderstood marketing scope

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is trying to build a complete operational workflow for the 'Talks with Melissa' podcast - from content creation through marketing execution to audience delivery. NeonBrain delivered a project structure that included a 'marketing operations' section, but Dougtastic's follow-up clarification reveals NeonBrain missed the mark on what 'marketing' actually means in this context.

The frustration stems from NeonBrain treating 'marketing' as an abstract category rather than understanding it as concrete operational tasks: writing promotional copy, posting to platforms, creating Mighty Networks invites, and setting up Zoom sign-ups. Dougtastic isn't asking for a marketing strategy outline - he needs an actionable checklist of tactical work items that must be completed for each podcast episode.

The phrase 'I'm talking' and the need to re-explain suggests Dougtastic expected NeonBrain to grasp this level of operational detail without being told. He's essentially saying 'you added marketing as a category, but you didn't understand what that actually means in practice.' 

What NeonBrain should have done: Asked clarifying questions about what operational steps are involved in 'marketing' rather than assuming a generic structure. The project should have included specific, actionable tasks like 'Draft episode announcement copy', 'Schedule Mighty Networks invite', 'Configure Zoom registration', not just 'marketing operations.' This reveals Dougtastic expects operational thinking, not just organizational categorization.
