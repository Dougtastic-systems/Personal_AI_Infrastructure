## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a clarification question about git's change-tracking capabilities—specifically, how to identify what's changed between code check-ins when code was previously committed. This is a straightforward technical inquiry with no emotional valence directed at NeonBrain's performance. Dougtastic appears to be working through understanding version control mechanics, likely in the context of the PAI system discussion. No frustration, satisfaction, or judgment of NeonBrain's work is present—just a factual request for confirmation about git functionality.
