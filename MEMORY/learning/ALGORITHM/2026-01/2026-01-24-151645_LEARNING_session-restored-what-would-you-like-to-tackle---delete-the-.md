   Task: Continue PAI v2.4 cleanup session

📋 SUMMARY: Welcome back, Dougtastic. I see the v2.4 upgrade went well last session - statusline bug fixed, context counter working. Ready to tackle the remaining cleanup tasks.

**Remaining items from your notes:**
1. **Delete backup** - `rm -rf ~/.claude-backup-pre-v2.4` (when you're confident)
2. **Push to GitHub** - needs workflow scope token
3. **Voice server** - optional, for notifications
4. **Check for updates** - `/upgrade`
