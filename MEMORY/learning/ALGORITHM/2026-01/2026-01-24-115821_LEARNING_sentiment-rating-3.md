# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated rate limits prevented quick completion

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is experiencing mounting frustration with rate limiting issues that are preventing quick completion of a task. The key context is that Dougtastic intentionally tried to make a smaller data request specifically to avoid hitting rate limits and get the work done efficiently. This reveals a strategic attempt to work around known limitations that still failed. NeonBrain's response about Neo4j being 'fully loaded and usable NOW' may have missed the point - Dougtastic wasn't trying to load Neo4j, but rather make a smaller data request to bypass rate limits entirely. The frustration stems from: (1) hitting rate limits despite deliberately scaling down the request, (2) the interruption to workflow momentum, and (3) potentially being given a workaround (Neo4j) when the goal was to avoid workarounds altogether. NeonBrain should have either: (a) acknowledged the failed strategy and offered specific guidance on how small is small enough to avoid limits, (b) proactively suggested the exact request size/format that would work, or (c) explained why even the smaller request still triggered limits. The pattern here shows Dougtastic values efficiency and gets frustrated when proactive attempts to avoid problems still fail.
