```
📁 ~/.claude/MEMORY/continuations/2026-01-21_graphiti-tuning.md
```

**Contains:**
- Full context of what we built (tuning loop, preprocessor, Financial entity type)
- Current scores (Entity F1: 83.3%, Currency: 100%, Tasks: 46.2%)
- Exact problem analysis (TC006 extracts people but not action phrases)
- Next steps for Task extraction improvement
- Commands to resume

📊 **STATUS: Session Summary**

| What | Result |
|------|--------|
| **Tuning Infrastructure** | ✅ Built (ground_truth.json, TuningLoop.py) |
| **Currency Extraction** | ✅ Fixed: 0% → 100% |
| **Entity F1** | ✅ Improved: 80.8% → 83.3% |
| **Task Extraction** | 🔄 In Progress: 46.2% → target 80% |

➡️ **TO RESUME:**

In new context, say:
> "Continue Graphiti tuning" or "Pick up Task extraction tuning"

Or read the continuation directly:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/MEMORY/continuations/2026-01-21_graphiti-tuning.md
```

📖 **STORY EXPLANATION:**
1. Built complete tuning loop infrastructure with 10 test cases
2. Fixed currency extraction from 0% to 100% via Financial entity type
3. Improved overall Entity F1 from 80.8% to 83.3%
4. Identified Task extraction as key gap for verbal-to-action processing
5. Analyzed root cause: LLM extracts people/concepts but not action phrases
6. Created continuation file with full context and next steps
7. Added to continuations INDEX for easy resume
8. Ready to pick up Task extraction in fresh context window

⭐ **RATE (1-10):**

🗣️ NeonBrain: Continuation created. Currency fixed, Task extraction at 46% ready to resume in new window.
