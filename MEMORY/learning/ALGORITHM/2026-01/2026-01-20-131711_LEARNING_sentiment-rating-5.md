## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is confirming the server issue is resolved ('ok seeing it now') and immediately moving on to request new features. This is a business-as-usual interaction - no emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's work, just a functional acknowledgment followed by development requirements. He's asking for: 1) A 4th panel between schema and SQL/Results to display nested pipelines/steps with clickable SHOW STEP functionality, and 2) CSV export from results. The tone is task-oriented and collaborative. While the 'ok' confirms the problem is fixed, there's no praise or frustration - just a neutral transition to next tasks. The context suggests Dougtastic was blocked by the server issue, NeonBrain helped resolve it, and now he's continuing work flow. This is a typical working session cadence, not a moment requiring sentiment scoring.
