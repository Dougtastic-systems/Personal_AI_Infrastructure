## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is providing a factual status update about his Citi statements being ready for analysis. This is a straightforward informational message with no emotional indicators - no frustration, no satisfaction, just logistics. He's confirming that he's placed 2 Citi statements in the same folder as other financial documents they've been working with. This is part of an ongoing task where NeonBrain is helping him analyze his financial data, and he's simply communicating progress. There's no sentiment directed at NeonBrain's performance - it's pure task coordination. This represents the baseline of neutral interaction during collaborative work where Dougtastic is simply keeping NeonBrain informed of task progress.
