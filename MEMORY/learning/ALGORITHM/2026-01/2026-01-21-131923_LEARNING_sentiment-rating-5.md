## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was explaining that a performance test is already running elsewhere, and clarifying what he actually needs: not just running tests, but developing a strategy for ongoing tuning and optimization that can be validated through comparison/triangulation. This is a course correction - NeonBrain started executing a test, but Dougtastic wants higher-level strategic thinking about the continuous optimization process itself. This isn't frustration with NeonBrain's work; it's clarification of the actual goal. Dougtastic is redirecting from tactical execution (running one test) to strategic planning (how to systematically tune over time). The message shows Dougtastic engaged in collaborative problem-solving, explaining his real intent after NeonBrain took an action. No emotional charge toward NeonBrain - just normal back-and-forth refinement of requirements. The 'So what I really want' phrase indicates gentle correction rather than criticism.
