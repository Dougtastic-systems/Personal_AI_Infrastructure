## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is making strategic decisions about workflow continuation. He's asking about: (1) estimated context usage in current window, (2) whether to continue in new context window(s), (3) whether to work on multiple tasks simultaneously (Neo4j plan + current work), and (4) requesting simple continuation prompts for new windows. This is pure logistical planning - no emotional response to NeonBrain's work. He's being methodical about resource management and task prioritization. The message shows good project management thinking but contains no indicators of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with what NeonBrain has done. It's a neutral request for information and recommendations about workflow optimization. No profanity, no frustration markers, no praise - just practical questions about how to proceed efficiently.
