## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic informed NeonBrain that a new PDF had dropped in a folder, expecting the AI to handle ingestion into Dot memory. NeonBrain attempted to process it but immediately failed with a generic error message ('PDF too large'). The assistant then suggested Dougtastic try a different approach himself, rather than actually solving the problem. Dougtastic's response 'what?' indicates confusion and mild frustration - he expected NeonBrain to handle this task autonomously, not tell him to do it manually with CLI tools. The root cause is NeonBrain failing at a routine task (PDF ingestion) and then deflecting responsibility back to Dougtastic instead of trying alternative approaches. NeonBrain should have: 1) Automatically tried the suggested CLI approach itself, 2) Provided more specific error details, 3) Asked clarifying questions about the PDF if size was truly an issue, or 4) Broken the file into chunks. The 'what?' suggests Dougtastic is thinking 'Why are you telling ME to use CLI tools? That's YOUR job.' This reveals Dougtastic expects proactive problem-solving, not instructions on how to solve it himself.
