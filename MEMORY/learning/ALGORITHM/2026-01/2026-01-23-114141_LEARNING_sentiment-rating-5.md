## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about whether NeonBrain can automatically resume a session when opened in a new terminal window after his API limit resets. This is a practical workflow question with no emotional content directed at NeonBrain's performance. The question shows he's thinking about system automation and workflow optimization, but there's no frustration or satisfaction being expressed - just curiosity about technical capabilities. The context shows he was previously working on TELOS extraction and session continuation, so this appears to be part of his workflow planning. No rating is appropriate here as this is pure information-seeking behavior with no sentiment toward NeonBrain's work quality or behavior.
