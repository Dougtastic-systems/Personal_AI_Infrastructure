📋 SUMMARY: Excellent test session captured! Analyzing the VProcessing export for parsing validation.

🔍 ANALYSIS: This is a rich 18-page session that demonstrates the full system working:

## Parsed Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-01-19 |
| **Session Start** | 3:42 PM PST (initial, wrong) → corrected to 6:16 PM PT |
| **Session End** | 6:18 PM PT |
| **Session-ID** | 20260119-1816-brainstorm |
| **Duration** | ~36 minutes |
| **Modes Used** | BRAINSTORM → REFLECT → STRATEGIC |

## Session Structure Detected

✅ `═══ SESSION START ═══` — found on page 1
✅ `═══ MODE SWITCH ═══` — BRAINSTORM → REFLECT (page 3)
✅ `═══ MODE SWITCH ═══` — BRAINSTORM → STRATEGIC (page 15)
✅ `═══ SESSION END ═══` — found on page 18

## Key Content Captured

**Your thinking (source:primary):**
- Lalo feedback work — decided to start early rather than defer
- Hemingway bridge insight — don't return to blank page
- Caught timestamp error at 5:57 when GPT showed 3:42
- Pushed for deterministic time via code interpreter

**GPT synthesis (source:gpt-synthesis):**
- REFLECT mode organized your Lalo work into: Observations, Questions, Tensions, Intentions
- STRATEGIC mode surfaced the core bet: "verbal-first GPT as durable thinking infrastructure"
- Time authority rules defined and validated

## Issues Noted

⚠️ **Initial timestamp was fabricated** (3:42 PM) — you caught this and fixed the instructions
✅ **After enabling code interpreter** — timestamps became accurate (6:16 PM, 6:18 PM)

📊 STATUS: PDF captured and readable. The delimiters survived PDF export cleanly.

➡️ NEXT: Want me to build a dedicated parser that:
1. Extracts sessions by delimiter blocks
2. Separates Doug statements from GPT responses
3. Creates structured markdown in `MEMORY/captured/processed/verbal/`
4. Tags appropriately for later retrieval?
