## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward logistical question about the sprint planning system. He wants to know whether future sprints (beyond the current Sprint 7) contain actual pending work items or if they're just placeholder structure. This is a neutral, administrative query - he's not expressing any emotion about NeonBrain's work or decisions. He's simply gathering information to understand the current state of the project roadmap. There's no frustration, approval, or any emotional indicator present. This is the type of question where a rating doesn't apply - it's purely informational fact-finding. The question shows Dougtastic is thinking ahead about project organization, but that's just good planning, not sentiment toward the AI assistant.
