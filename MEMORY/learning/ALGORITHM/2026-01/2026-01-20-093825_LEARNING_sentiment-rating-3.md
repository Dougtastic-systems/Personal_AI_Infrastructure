## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is experiencing a download issue where files appear as 0-byte placeholders. NeonBrain analyzed the problem and suggested it was a browser-specific issue (Firefox), recommending trying Chrome as an alternative. However, Dougtastic has already attempted this solution before NeonBrain suggested it, indicating the AI didn't fully assess what troubleshooting steps had been taken. This represents a common failure pattern: suggesting obvious solutions without first checking what's already been tried. The frustration here is mild but real - Dougtastic is stuck with a technical problem and the AI's first suggestion was redundant. NeonBrain should have asked 'What have you already tried?' before jumping to solutions, or at minimum acknowledged that browser-switching is an obvious first step. The root issue is that NeonBrain is playing catch-up rather than staying ahead of the problem. For positive interactions, NeonBrain needs to demonstrate it understands the full context before offering solutions, especially for technical debugging where users typically try obvious fixes first.

## Assistant Response Context

➡️ **NEXT:** Since the browser download keeps failing, you have two options:

**Option 1:** Try downloading in Chrome instead of Firefox
- Go to https://neo4j.com/download/

**Option 2:** Skip Neo4j Desktop for now
- We already have Neo4j running via Homebrew with browser console at localhost:7474
- Desktop is just a nicer UI - it's optional
- We can proceed with Phase 2 (driver, MCP server, etc.) without it

Would you like to try Chrome, or skip Desktop and continue with the wiring phase?
