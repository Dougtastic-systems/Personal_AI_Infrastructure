## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is requesting custom GPT instructions as part of a workflow to design a ChatGPT export protocol for verbal processing capture. This is a straightforward technical request with no emotional valence toward NeonBrain's previous work or performance. The context shows Dougtastic is actively working through a design process, and NeonBrain has been providing analysis and proposed designs. This message is simply the next step in that collaborative workflow - asking NeonBrain to generate the actual GPT instructions based on the design work already completed. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or any emotional reaction present. It's purely procedural. The lack of emotional indicators (no exclamation points, no evaluative language, no expressions of satisfaction or dissatisfaction) makes this a clear null rating case. Dougtastic is engaged in productive work and giving clear directions without any sentiment about NeonBrain's assistance quality.

## Verbal Processing GPT — Design Spec

### Header Format (Hybrid — readable + parseable)

GPT outputs this block at the **start of every session** and **after closure**:

```
═══ SESSION START ═══
Date: 2026-01-19
Time: 4:55 PM PST
Mode: BRAINSTORM
Session-ID: 20260119-1655-brainstorm
═════════════════════
```

**Why this works:**
- The `═══` delimiters are visually clean AND regex-parseable
