## Assistant Response Context

📋 **SUMMARY:** For personal use, these can be placeholder values

**Enter these:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Website URL** | `http://localhost:5180` |
| **Terms of Service URL** | `http://localhost:5180` |

These are required fields but don't matter for personal/local use — Oura just needs something there. Since you're the only user, any valid URL works.

🗣️ NeonBrain: Use localhost:5180 for both Website URL and Terms of Service. They're just placeholders.
