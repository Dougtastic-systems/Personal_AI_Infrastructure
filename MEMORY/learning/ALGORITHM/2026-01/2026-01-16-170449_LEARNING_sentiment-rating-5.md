**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Factual confirmation - no emotional indicators

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is simply confirming a factual status - that all three browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome) already have the extension installed. There's no emotional language, no frustration, no satisfaction - just a straightforward statement of fact. The message is a direct response to NeonBrain's instructions about setting up Safari and Chrome extensions, informing that this step is unnecessary because the extensions already exist across all browsers. This is pure informational exchange without any evaluative component about NeonBrain's performance or suggestions. The tone is matter-of-fact and neutral, providing status update rather than feedback on NeonBrain's work. No sentiment toward NeonBrain is expressed or implied.
