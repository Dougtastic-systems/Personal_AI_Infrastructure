## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is managing context window usage strategically. He successfully completed Phase 1 (temporal directory structure, index, work items, NOW state) and wants to move to Phase 2 in a fresh terminal window to minimize token usage. This is pragmatic project management - no frustration or satisfaction expressed about NeonBrain's work, just a straightforward command to prepare a continuation prompt. The message indicates Dougtastic understands the system architecture and is taking an active role in optimizing workflow. No sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance is present; this is purely logistical planning. Dougtastic appears satisfied enough with Phase 1 completion to move forward, but expresses no explicit approval or disapproval.
