## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a technical question about improving the chunking implementation for memory storage. He wants to modify the chunking algorithm to treat his own messages differently from ChatGPT/NeonBrain responses - specifically preserving his messages as complete units to enable better reprocessing and meaning extraction later. This is a constructive request focused on system improvement, not a reaction to NeonBrain's performance. The question shows Dougtastic is engaged with optimizing the memory system architecture and thinking about future retrieval quality. This is a neutral planning/design discussion without emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's current work. There's no frustration or satisfaction expressed - just architectural problem-solving about how to better preserve and process his personal data for downstream analysis.
