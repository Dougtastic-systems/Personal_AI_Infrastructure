## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking about context token estimation and usage, specifically wanting to ensure there's 'full room for each step.' This appears to be a technical inquiry about resource management rather than an emotional reaction to NeonBrain's performance. The phrasing suggests proactive planning - wanting to understand token budget constraints before proceeding with work. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or other sentiment directed at NeonBrain's actions. This is simply a clarifying question about system capabilities and limitations, similar to asking 'how much memory is available?' The context indicates ongoing work where Dougtastic wants to ensure adequate resources are allocated for each operation step. No emotional indicators present - this is pure technical discussion about operational parameters.
