## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is problem-solving how to share HTML artifacts with collaborators. He's thinking out loud about distribution methods (WhatsApp, Google Docs) and evaluating feasibility. This is a neutral technical exploration - he's not expressing satisfaction or frustration with NeonBrain's work, but rather working through logistics of a use case. The phrase 'just thinking through' indicates active brainstorming rather than reaction to NeonBrain's performance. No emotional indicators present; this is collaborative problem-solving. The 'right this second' suggests urgency about the use case, not about NeonBrain's response quality. This is the kind of message where Dougtastic is using NeonBrain as a thinking partner rather than evaluating its output.
