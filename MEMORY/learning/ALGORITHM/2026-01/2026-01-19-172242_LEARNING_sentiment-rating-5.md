## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is refining a custom GPT instruction template for a 'REFLECT Mode' feature. He wants to adjust the assistant's behavior to be more passive - focusing on recording and organizing his thoughts rather than providing commentary or emotional support. This is a straightforward technical request about template modification with clear requirements: reduce input level, emphasize documentation over interaction. The tone is matter-of-fact and instructional. There's no emotional response to NeonBrain's previous work - he's simply continuing the task with a specific refinement request. This represents normal iterative development work where specifications are being clarified.
