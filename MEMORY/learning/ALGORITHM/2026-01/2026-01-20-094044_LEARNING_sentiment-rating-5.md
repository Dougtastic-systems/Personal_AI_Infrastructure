## Assistant Response Context

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** Download is working but slow (~1.8MB so far). At this rate (~100KB/s), it would take about 80+ minutes for 500MB.

**Options:**
1. **Let it run** - It's downloading, just slow
2. **Skip Desktop entirely** - We already have the browser console working at localhost:7474
3. **Try later** - Maybe network is congested now

📊 **STATUS:** Download in progress but very slow (1.8MB / ~500MB)

➡️ **NEXT:** My recommendation: **Skip Neo4j Desktop for now** and continue with Phase 2 wiring
