## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was asking NeonBrain to ingest a chat transcript. After NeonBrain completed the ingestion, Dougtastic pointed out that there should be an automated workflow to move processed files to an archive subfolder - something NeonBrain apparently didn't do. This reveals frustration that NeonBrain failed to follow an established procedure that Dougtastic expected to happen automatically. The phrasing 'don't we' suggests this is a known system behavior that NeonBrain should have remembered and executed. The root cause is NeonBrain's failure to complete the full workflow - not just ingesting the file, but also performing the expected post-processing cleanup step. What NeonBrain should have done: After successfully ingesting the chat transcript, NeonBrain should have automatically moved the source file to an archive subfolder without needing to be reminded. This pattern reveals that Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to remember and execute complete workflows, not just isolated tasks. When established procedures exist, NeonBrain should proactively follow them rather than requiring explicit instruction for each step.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 **SUMMARY:** Ingested verbal processing session from 2025-01-08 (12:30-1:00 PM PST) into memory system.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** This was a significant session where you worked through key strategic decisions about PAI:
- **Scope reduction**: From "full personal AI system" → single reliable operational loop
- **First use case locked**: Work project management via verbal processing
- **Episode model defined**: 3-10 min bounded chunks, minimal metadata
- **Flow state protection**: Never force structur
