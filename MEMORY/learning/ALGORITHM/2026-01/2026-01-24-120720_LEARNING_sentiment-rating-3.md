## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is comparing his actual Claude API usage data (39% used, resets in 2:54 hours, weekly limits reset Saturday 10 AM at 5% for all models, Sonnet at 0%) with what NeonBrain is displaying on localhost:5172. The discrepancy between reality and what the UI shows is causing confusion and mild frustration. The phrase 'not what shows on local host 5172' indicates NeonBrain's interface is presenting incorrect or outdated usage information, which undermines trust in the system's accuracy. This is a data synchronization or display issue - the UI should accurately reflect his current API usage limits. For a personal AI system that Dougtastic relies on, displaying incorrect usage data could lead to unexpected rate limiting or poor decision-making about when to use which models. NeonBrain should ensure real-time or near-real-time accuracy of API usage displays, with clear timestamps showing when data was last updated. The frustration is mild (not angry) but points to a foundational issue: if basic usage stats are wrong, what else might be inaccurate?
