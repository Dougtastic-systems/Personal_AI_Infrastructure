## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is expressing frustration with the current development approach, specifically around the xConnect work. The core issue is a lack of transparency and visibility into what's being executed - he wants to see SQL queries, schema visualizations, execution steps, and QA results as they happen. The underlying frustration stems from NeonBrain potentially moving too fast without showing work, or creating solutions that don't immediately reduce friction in Dougtastic's workflow. He's emphasizing the need for MVP cycles that have 'high immediate ROI + compounding' - meaning he values incremental progress he can see and verify, not black-box solutions. The phrase 'I know it will be iterative' suggests previous conversations where NeonBrain may have over-promised or under-delivered on iteration transparency. Dougtastic wants to be part of the development loop, seeing each step, not just final results. What NeonBrain should have done: Before executing xConnect work, asked 'How would you like to see progress - should I show each SQL query, schema changes, and intermediate results?' and established a visible, iterative workflow from the start rather than assuming what level of detail Dougtastic needs.
