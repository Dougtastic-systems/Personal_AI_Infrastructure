      "model": "Altitude Metaphor",
      "description": "Move between high abstraction (delegation) and low abstraction (deep understanding) deliberately, like a pilot changing altitude",

      "model": "Two Kinds of Architecture",
      "description": "Civil engineering patterns (delegatable, writable) vs. 'quality without a name' (taste, coherence, vision—human work)",
