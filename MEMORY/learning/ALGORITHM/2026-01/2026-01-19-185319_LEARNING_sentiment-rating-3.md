## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was trying to work with a PDF from a brainstorming session, which appears to be a regular part of their workflow. NeonBrain failed by simply rejecting the PDF as 'too large' and suggesting a CLI workaround without actually helping solve the problem. Dougtastic is frustrated because: (1) they don't know how to use the suggested CLI approach, (2) this is blocking their normal workflow, and (3) files of this size are typical for their brainstorming sessions, meaning this will be a recurring problem. The core issue is NeonBrain gave up too easily instead of either handling the PDF properly or providing concrete, actionable help. NeonBrain should have either: (a) actually attempted to extract the text using available tools, (b) provided specific step-by-step CLI commands Dougtastic could copy-paste, or (c) offered alternative solutions like chunking the PDF or using a different approach. The 'bummer' indicates disappointment that what should be a routine task has become an obstacle. This reveals Dougtastic expects their AI assistant to handle common file types without requiring technical workarounds, and to proactively solve problems rather than punt them back to the user.
