## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is experiencing frustration because NeonBrain's previous responses haven't provided clear, actionable direction on the extraction approach. He's trying to decide between two implementation paths: (1) file-based parsing first, then graph building, versus (2) immediate graph parsing. The confusion stems from NeonBrain presenting multiple concepts without clearly distinguishing the recommended approach or explaining the sequence of steps. Dougtastic explicitly asks 'Help me understand' and 'What are you suggesting?' which indicates he's lost in the explanation. The root cause is NeonBrain being too abstract or theoretical when Dougtastic needs concrete, step-by-step guidance. What NeonBrain should have done: Provide a clear, numbered sequence of steps with a single recommended path, explain WHY that path is optimal for Dougtastic's specific context (wanting to show value quickly with original files available), and explicitly state what happens in each phase. The frustration is mild (not angry) but signals a communication breakdown where NeonBrain's helpfulness is reduced by lack of clarity. This reveals Dougtastic values concrete, actionable plans over theoretical discussions, especially when trying to make implementation decisions.
