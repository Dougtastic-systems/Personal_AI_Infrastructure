📋 SUMMARY: Reflection workflow complete and tested - AI extracts concepts, generates reflection questions, creates structured files for your input.

🔍 ANALYSIS: The workflow successfully:
- Extracted 5 key concepts from today's newsletter (Capability Saturation, Identity-Driven Throughput, Post-Prompting Optimization, Builder-First Strategy, Stickiness)
- Generated 3 deep reflection questions connecting to personal experience, challenging assumptions, prompting implementation
- Created structured reflection file with templates for your insights

⚡ ACTIONS:
1. Created `reflect.ts` with interactive + batch + weekly modes
2. Fixed inference path to use `skills/CORE/Tools/Inference.ts`
3. Created `Workflows/Reflection.md` documentation
4. Tested on today's newsletter - working

✅ RESULTS:

**Sample Reflection Output:**
```
Key Concepts:
- Capability Saturation Problem: When AI capability exceeds bottleneck
- Identity-Driven Throughput: Transform who you are, not just what you do
- Post-Prompting Optimization: Move beyond prompt engineering
- Builder-First Strategy: 2026 framework for creators
- Stickiness & Persistence: Lasting behavioral habits

Reflection Questions:
1. What identity shift from "needs better tools" to "needs better systems"...
2. What evidence would convince you your bottleneck is workflow structure...
3. What daily habits would you adopt to make the shift stick...
```

📖 STORY EXPLANATION:
1. Reflection workflow uses PAI's Inference tool for AI-powered extraction
2. Haiku model (fast) extracts concepts and generates questions quickly
3. Each newsletter gets a structured reflection template with prompts
4. Questions designed to connect concepts to your experience and implementation
5. Alignment check section tracks divergence from Nate's thinking over time
6. Weekly synthesis aggregates patterns across 7 days of content
7. All files link back to original newsletters for easy reference
8. Status tracking (To Review → Processed → Reflected) shows progress
