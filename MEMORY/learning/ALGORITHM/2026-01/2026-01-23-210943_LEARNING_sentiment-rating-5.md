## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a practical technical question about markdown formatting not rendering properly in Google Docs. This is a straightforward problem-solving inquiry with no emotional sentiment directed at NeonBrain. The context shows Dougtastic requested cleanup of a document to make it more readable, NeonBrain removed tables and used headers/bullet lists, but the markdown formatting isn't translating to Google Docs as expected. Dougtastic is simply asking what alternatives exist to achieve the desired formatting. This is a neutral troubleshooting conversation - Dougtastic isn't frustrated, just needs a solution. The brevity and matter-of-fact tone ('options?') indicates practical problem-solving mode rather than any emotional response to NeonBrain's work. No indicators of satisfaction or dissatisfaction present - just a technical limitation being addressed.
