## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Achieved 100% Type Accuracy in Graphiti entity extraction by enhancing docstrings and clearing cached entities.

🔍 ANALYSIS:
- **Root Cause of Type Misclassifications**: Docstrings needed more explicit pattern matching rules
- **Cache Discovery**: The tuning group (`paa-tuning-loop`) cached old entities with outdated types - clearing it was essential
- **LLM Variance**: Entity F1 fluctuates 82-86% due to inherent LLM extraction variability (not a docstring issue)
