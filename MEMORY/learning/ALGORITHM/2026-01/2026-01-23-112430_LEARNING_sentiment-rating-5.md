## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is articulating a critical workflow gap: valuable insights emerge during conversation but aren't systematically captured for Telos (his personal knowledge/philosophy system). He's specifically requesting: (1) extract his design comments and theories from this conversation into Telos, (2) if extraction isn't easy, we need to solve that problem, (3) he identifies this as the 'most lossy' part of his process - ideas happening 'while doing something else' then getting lost, (4) breakthrough insights during conversation need capture for his 'why I do what I do' framework. This isn't expressing sentiment toward NeonBrain's work - it's identifying a systemic problem in our workflow. He's being collaborative and constructive, pointing out a bottleneck that needs solving. The frustration is with the *process gap*, not with NeonBrain's performance. This is valuable meta-feedback about workflow design, not performance feedback. The absence of emotional language (no 'great', 'frustrating', 'love', 'hate') and the focus on 'we should', 'we need to figure out' indicates collaborative problem-solving mode rather than evaluative sentiment.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Created project history structure, moved briefs to dated archive, created convergence brief, and identified Graphiti research for engineering review.

🔍 ANALYSIS: 
**Found in existing Graphiti research:**
- ~10-20 LLM calls per episode ingestion
- Current cost: ~$0.10-0.50 per 1000-word episode (Sonnet/GPT-4)
- LLM client is a constructor parameter (medium complexity to swap)
- GitHub #1135 tracks "configurable small model for cost reduction" as planned feature
- **Key risk**: Quali
