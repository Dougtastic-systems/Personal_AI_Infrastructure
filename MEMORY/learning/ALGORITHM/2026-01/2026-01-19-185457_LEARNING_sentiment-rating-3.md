## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic encountered a problem with a large PDF file (likely an exported ChatGPT conversation) and asked NeonBrain for help. NeonBrain's first response was vague, suggesting a 'CLI tool' without specifics. When Dougtastic explicitly said he doesn't know what CLI tool to use and asked for a concrete solution, NeonBrain simply repeated the exact same unhelpful message. This failure to provide actionable guidance or specific tool recommendations created frustration. The current message shows Dougtastic pivoting to request a different approach - creating a continuation prompt system to handle large PDFs. The root issue was NeonBrain's lack of specificity when Dougtastic needed concrete help, then doubling down by repeating the same vague advice. NeonBrain should have immediately suggested specific tools (pdftotext, PyPDF2, Apache Tika, etc.) with usage examples, or proposed alternative solutions like chunking strategies or web-based PDF parsers. The repeated generic response made Dougtastic feel unheard and forced him to completely reframe his request. This reveals Dougtastic expects practical, implementable solutions with specific commands or code, not abstract suggestions.
