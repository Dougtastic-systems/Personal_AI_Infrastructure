## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is providing factual information about which browsers he uses (Safari, Firefox, and Chrome) in response to NeonBrain's question about whether to build extensions for additional browsers. This is a straightforward clarification with no emotional content directed at NeonBrain's performance. The statement is purely informational - Dougtastic is simply correcting NeonBrain's assumption that he only uses Firefox. There's no frustration about NeonBrain's previous response, no disappointment, and no particular satisfaction either. This is a neutral exchange where Dougtastic is helping NeonBrain understand his needs better so the AI can provide a more informed recommendation about whether to build browser extensions for Safari and Chrome in addition to the Firefox extension he's already created. The context shows Dougtastic is engaged in the conversation and willing to provide information, but there's no sentiment about NeonBrain's work or capabilities being expressed here.
