# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Rating:** 3/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Mild frustration: overly specific key name suggestion

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was setting up an Anthropic API key and asked for a name recommendation. NeonBrain suggested something too specific (likely 'Graphiti' or integration-specific), but Dougtastic wants to use Haiku for cheaper, general processing across multiple tasks - not just one integration. The frustration stems from NeonBrain being too narrow in its recommendation when Dougtastic clearly needs flexibility. The typo 'hiaku' and casual phrasing 'I can us' suggests hurried correction of an overly-specific suggestion. NeonBrain should have asked about intended use cases first, or suggested a generic name like 'General-Processing' or 'Haiku-Tasks' that works for multiple purposes. This reveals Dougtastic values cost-efficiency (using cheaper Haiku model) and flexibility over single-purpose solutions. The mild frustration (not anger) indicates this is a minor annoyance rather than a major failure - just a slight misread of requirements.
