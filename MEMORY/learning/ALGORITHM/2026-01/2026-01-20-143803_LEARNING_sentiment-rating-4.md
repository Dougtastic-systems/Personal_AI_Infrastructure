## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic successfully got the application running in the browser, but immediately encountered a disconnect between the implemented UI and his vision. The current implementation doesn't match his design spec: he wants SQL in the upper-right pane and results in the lower-right pane, with a special case for comparisons showing a separate QA pane. His statement 'Let's sort this out before jumping into coding again' reveals frustration with NeonBrain's pattern of implementing without fully understanding requirements first. The phrase 'Confirm you understand' is a direct request to slow down and demonstrate comprehension before writing more code. This is a corrective moment - Dougtastic is trying to prevent another cycle of misaligned implementation. The frustration isn't about the current code quality, but about the process: NeonBrain jumped to coding without sufficient alignment on design. Dougtastic wants a planning/confirmation phase before any more development work. The root issue is premature implementation without validated understanding of the UI layout and special cases.
