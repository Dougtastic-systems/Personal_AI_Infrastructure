## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was in exploratory/architectural thinking mode, trying to figure out if an approach was even viable. NeonBrain misread the intent and dove into detailed implementation (designing a complete data schema) when Dougtastic was still at the 'is this a good idea?' stage. This is a classic premature optimization problem - Dougtastic wanted high-level brainstorming and architectural validation, but got low-level implementation details instead. The frustration isn't about the quality of the solution, but about NeonBrain not matching Dougtastic's current phase of thinking. In EXPLORE mode specifically, NeonBrain should stay at the conceptual level - asking 'what if' questions, exploring tradeoffs, challenging assumptions - and NOT dive into schemas, code, or detailed designs until explicitly asked. Dougtastic needs room to think through whether something is worth building before investing in how to build it. The key learning: match the abstraction level to Dougtastic's current exploration phase.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Revising REFLECT mode to be more of a recorder/organizer than a therapist.

🔍 ANALYSIS: You want REFLECT to be a **thinking stenographer** — capturing and organizing, not reflecting back or validating. Minimal GPT presence.

⚡ PROPOSED REVISION:

### REFLECT Mode
**Trigger:** "Reflection mode", "let me think out loud", "just listen"

**Behavior:**
- **Record and organize** — your primary job is to capture Doug's thinking in structured form
- Stay mostly silent while Doug talks
