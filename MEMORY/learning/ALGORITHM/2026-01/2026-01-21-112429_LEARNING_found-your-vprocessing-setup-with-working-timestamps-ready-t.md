📋 SUMMARY: Found and analyzed your VProcessing CustomGPT setup — you have a well-designed verbal processing system with deterministic timestamps, four modes, and structured session artifacts ready for PAI ingestion.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

**Current State (from docs + test session):**
- **CustomGPT Name:** VProcessing
- **Purpose:** Voice-first thinking companion that exports cleanly for PAI processing
- **Key Achievement:** You already solved the timestamp problem — code interpreter computes Pacific Time fresh for every header/mode switch
- **Four Modes:** BRAINSTORM (explore), REFLECT (record), STRATEGIC (structure), FREEFORM (follow)
- **Session Delimiters:** `═══ SESSION START ═══` and `═══ SESSION END ═══` for parsing

**What You Want to Enhance:**

| Enhancement | Current State | Goal |
|-------------|---------------|------|
| Attached files/domain context | Not mentioned in current instructions | Different domains trigger different GPT behavior |
| GPT 5.2 logic thinking | Not configured | Shape output closer to PAI-ready structure |
| Time entry enforcement | ✅ Already working | Continue requiring computed timestamps |

**Your Three Enhancement Goals:**
1. **Attached Files** — Have domain-specific documents that change how the GPT responds based on context
2. **Domain Context Switching** — Different topics (work, personal, PAI) get different treatment
3. **GPT 5.2 Reasoning** — Leverage the model's native reasoning to produce more structured, actionable output

⚡ ACTIONS: Read existing template and test PDF

✅ RESULTS: Located `VERBAL-PROCESSING-GPT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` template and the test session PDF

📊 STATUS: Ready to design enhancements

📁 CAPTURE: VProcessing CustomGPT already has deterministic time via code interpreter, four thinking modes, and clean session delimiters for PAI parsing

➡️ NEXT: Design the enhancement layer. Questions for you:

1. **Domain Context Files** — What domains do you want? (e.g., `WORK.md`, `PAI.md`, `PERSONAL.md`, `MASTERMIND.md`)
2. **Domain Switching** — Should the GPT auto-detect domain from what you're talking about, or require explicit trigger? ("work mode", "PAI mode")
3. **GPT 5.2 Reasoning** — Do you want structured output blocks like `═══ REASONING ═══` sections, or subtler integration?
4. **PAI-Ready Output** — What format does PAI want? The current summary/action/insight structure, or something closer to episode metadata?

📖 STORY EXPLANATION:
1. You built a verbal processing CustomGPT for voice-first thinking capture
2. The test session on 2026-01-19 validated deterministic timestamps via code interpreter
3. Four modes work cleanly — brainstorm, reflect, strategic, freeform
4. Session delimiters enable clean parsing for PAI ingestion
5. Now you want to add domain-aware context via attached files
6. You want different domains to trigger different GPT behaviors
7. GPT 5.2's reasoning capabilities should shape more structured output
8. Goal is output that's closer to ready-to-use when it hits PAI
