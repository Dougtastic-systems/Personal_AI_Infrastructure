## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic had just received a report showing improved Relationship F1 scores from ~66.8% to 70-77% after enhanced edge type docstrings. Instead of celebrating the improvement, he immediately asked 'which relationships are still failing,' indicating dissatisfaction with incomplete success. The frustration stems from: (1) The improvement wasn't complete/perfect, (2) NeonBrain didn't proactively identify which specific relationships still need work, forcing Dougtastic to ask. This reveals a pattern where Dougtastic expects comprehensive analysis - not just 'we improved X%' but 'here's what still needs fixing and why.' NeonBrain should have anticipated this follow-up question and included in the initial report: a breakdown of which relationship types are still underperforming, specific F1 scores per type, and hypotheses about why certain relationships remain problematic. The tone ('which relationships are still failing') suggests impatience with having to extract information that should have been obvious to provide. This is constructive frustration - he's engaged and wants to solve the problem, but annoyed at inefficient information flow.
