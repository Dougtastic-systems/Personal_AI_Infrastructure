## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic requested to see the revised prototype UI. NeonBrain created the file and reported it was 'live in Chrome' at localhost:8766/revised.html, but the browser window didn't actually open for Dougtastic. This created confusion - Dougtastic had to clarify that nothing happened on their end, mentioning they have many windows open (suggesting the window might be hidden, or more likely, never opened at all). The phrase 'did it ask my permission?' suggests Dougtastic is trying to understand why the expected action (browser opening) didn't occur. The frustration is mild (hence rating 3) - this is a minor technical hiccup, but it disrupted the workflow. The core issue: NeonBrain claimed the prototype was 'live in Chrome' when it apparently only created the file but didn't successfully open it in the browser. This is a communication gap - NeonBrain should either: (1) actually open the browser window automatically, (2) clearly state 'I've created the file at X, would you like me to open it?', or (3) explain if browser opening requires permission/failed. The lesson: don't claim something is 'live in Chrome' unless you've verified the browser actually opened, or be explicit about what action Dougtastic needs to take.
