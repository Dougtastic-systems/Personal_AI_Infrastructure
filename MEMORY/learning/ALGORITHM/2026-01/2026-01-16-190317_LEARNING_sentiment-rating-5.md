## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is simply clarifying that he's looking at a different file (ArtistContext.md) in Daniel's repository, not the Video.md file that NeonBrain couldn't find. This is a factual correction with no emotional indicators. There's no frustration about the failed lookup - he's just providing context for what he's actually doing. No positive or negative sentiment toward NeonBrain's work. This is a neutral, informational message that doesn't warrant a rating.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 **SUMMARY:** The file `skills/Art/Workflows/Video.md` does not exist in this repository.

🔍 **ANALYSIS:** 
- Searched for the file at the expected path — not found
- Globbed all Art workflow files — no Video.md exists
- Grepped for "Video" mentions across markdown files — found 29 references but none are a Video workflow

The Art skill contains these workflows instead:
- **Visualize.md** — General visualization
- **Mermaid.md** — Diagram generation
- **TechnicalDiagrams.md** — Technical arch
