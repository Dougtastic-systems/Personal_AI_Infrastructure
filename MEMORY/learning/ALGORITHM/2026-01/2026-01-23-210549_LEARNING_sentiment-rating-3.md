## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic pasted content (V2) into Rick's Google Doc but found the layout problematic due to an 'artificial table' that made the document harder to read. NeonBrain successfully completed the technical task (copying to clipboard, opening the doc) but the output format was poor. The frustration stems from NeonBrain not anticipating that pasted content would need formatting consideration - it just dumped raw content without thinking about readability. Dougtastic now has to request cleanup work that should have been done proactively. The 'artificial table' likely refers to markdown or structured data that rendered poorly in Google Docs. NeonBrain should have either: 1) warned about potential formatting issues before pasting, 2) offered to format the content appropriately for Google Docs, or 3) automatically cleaned up the formatting. This reveals Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to think ahead about presentation quality, not just complete literal commands. The mild frustration (rating 3) indicates this is an annoying but fixable issue - not a major failure, just sloppy execution that created extra work.
