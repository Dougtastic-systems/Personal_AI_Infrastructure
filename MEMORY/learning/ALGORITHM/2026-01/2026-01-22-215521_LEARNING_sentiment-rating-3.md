# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Rating:** 3/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Mild frustration with NeonBrain's reading comprehension

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic asked NeonBrain if it had read the instructions about obtaining an Oura token, expressing confusion ('not obvious to me'). NeonBrain responded with information about Personal Access Tokens, but Dougtastic's follow-up message 'I wasn't able - check this for instructions and guidance' indicates NeonBrain either didn't address the right question or didn't properly read/understand what Dougtastic was asking about. The frustration stems from NeonBrain appearing to not have actually checked or understood the specific instructions Dougtastic was referencing. This reveals a pattern where Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to thoroughly read and comprehend provided documentation before responding, rather than giving generic information. NeonBrain should have: (1) explicitly confirmed it read the specific instructions Dougtastic referenced, (2) acknowledged what was unclear about them, and (3) either explained the confusing parts or asked clarifying questions about what specifically wasn't obvious. The core issue is a comprehension/communication gap where NeonBrain didn't demonstrate it had actually engaged with the material Dougtastic was asking about.
