# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Neutral request for specific technical instructions

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking for explicit command-line instructions to run Claude Code in a Terminal window. He self-identifies as inexperienced with this ('virgin here'), indicating he needs step-by-step guidance. This is a straightforward technical question without emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain. The 'virgin' comment is self-deprecating about his own knowledge gap, not expressing frustration with the AI. NeonBrain had explained the concept (parallel Claude sessions in separate terminals) but hadn't yet provided the actual commands to execute. Dougtastic needs the practical 'how-to' - the exact terminal command syntax. This represents a normal clarifying question in a technical workflow. No sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance is expressed; he's simply asking for the next procedural step. The appropriate response would be providing the specific command (likely 'code .' or similar) with any necessary context about directory location or setup.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Confirming yes - separate Terminal windows work great for parallel Claude sessions

🔍 ANALYSIS: Absolutely yes. Each Terminal window running `claude` is an independent session with its own full context. This is actually the recommended approach for parallel work streams.

⚡ ACTIONS: Here are your ready-to-copy continuation prompts:

---

**Terminal 1 - xConnect IDE (Sprint 6):**
```
Continue xConnect IDE Sprint 6. Read ~/.claude/WORK/xConnect/ide/CONTINUATION-S6.md

Start with layou
