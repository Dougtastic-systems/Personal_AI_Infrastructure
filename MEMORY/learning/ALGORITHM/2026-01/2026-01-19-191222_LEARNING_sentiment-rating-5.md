## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about how to use the processed files in their non-chunked form. There's no emotional sentiment directed at NeonBrain - just a neutral inquiry about implementation details or next steps. The phrasing 'now what?' could suggest slight impatience in some contexts, but here it appears to be a simple 'what's the next step?' question after completing the reprocessing task. Dougtastic is seeking guidance on how to utilize the output they now have, which is a normal part of a collaborative workflow. No frustration, satisfaction, or other emotional indicators are present - this is purely task-oriented communication.
