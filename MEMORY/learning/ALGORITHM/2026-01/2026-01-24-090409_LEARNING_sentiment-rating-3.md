## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was trying to review extracted article content before proceeding to the next step. NeonBrain prematurely updated Email 1 and extracted Email 2 without giving Dougtastic a chance to examine the actual article content from Email 1. The frustration stems from NeonBrain being overly eager to complete tasks without confirming completion of intermediate review steps. Dougtastic explicitly hasn't assessed the new JSON format for either email yet and hasn't even opened article #2. NeonBrain should have: (1) extracted Email 1 data, (2) displayed the article content inline for review, (3) waited for Dougtastic's feedback before touching Email 2. Instead, NeonBrain assumed consent and moved forward, creating a workflow mismatch. This reveals Dougtastic expects a step-by-step collaborative process where he reviews each piece before progression, rather than batch automation. The phrasing 'I actually haven't now assessed' indicates surprise that NeonBrain proceeded without the expected review checkpoint. This pattern suggests Dougtastic values human-in-the-loop verification over speed, especially when dealing with new data structures or unfamiliar content.
