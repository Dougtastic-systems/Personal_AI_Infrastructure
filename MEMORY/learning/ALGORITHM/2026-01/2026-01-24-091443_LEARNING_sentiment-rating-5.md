## Assistant Response Context

**Thoughts on Goldilocks Balance**

Looking at the two extractions against this question, here's my analysis:

**Keep (high value, no redundancy):**
- `mental_models[]` - Core to Nate's thinking style. Rich structure justified.
- `assertions[]` - Already captures claims. *Enhance* with optional `implication` field rather than creating separate `strategic_assertions`.
- `work_transformation{}` - Unique to Nate's focus on "how work is changing." Keep.
- `people_mentioned[]`, `companies_mentioned[]
