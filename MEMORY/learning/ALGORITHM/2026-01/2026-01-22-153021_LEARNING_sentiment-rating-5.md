## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking NeonBrain to engage in high-level systems architecture thinking about temporal coordination features. This is a continuation of a design conversation about reducing work surfaces and integrating planning with execution. The question is framed as a request for expertise ('think knowledge worker systems architect') rather than feedback on something NeonBrain did. There's no emotional valence toward NeonBrain's performance - this is a collaborative ideation request. The tone is professional and forward-looking, asking for feature design input to solve the unified planning/execution surface problem they've been discussing. This represents productive strategic thinking, not a reaction to NeonBrain's work quality.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: This is the right principle — one surface for plan AND execute eliminates context-switch tax.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

**The Problem:**
```
Current: Plan in Notion → Schedule in Calendar → Execute in IDE → Track in Todoist
         ↓ switch ↓        ↓ switch ↓           ↓ switch ↓
         🧠 ADHD tax on every jump
```

**The Goal:**
```
PAI: Plan → Schedule → Execute → Track
     └────────────────────────────────┘
              ONE SURFACE
```
