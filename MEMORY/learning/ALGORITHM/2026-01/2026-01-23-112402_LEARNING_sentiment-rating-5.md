## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is making strategic planning requests for business work (value proposition infographic and marketing plan visualization). This message contains zero emotional indicators about NeonBrain's performance - it's purely directional. He's thinking through his business needs: visualizing value props for himself and his partner Rick, understanding hierarchy/weighting of concepts, and seeing how current iteration work fits into the broader marketing plan. The tone is thoughtful and exploratory ('I'll have to figure that out', 'just how to think about'), not evaluative of NeonBrain. No praise, no frustration, no surprise - just a user articulating what he wants to see next. This is standard task delegation with strategic context, not feedback on AI performance.
