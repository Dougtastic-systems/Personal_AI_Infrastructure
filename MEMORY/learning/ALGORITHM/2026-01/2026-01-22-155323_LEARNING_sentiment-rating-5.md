## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is issuing a straightforward command to analyze information from another session and provide recommendations. This is a typical workflow instruction showing Dougtastic is working across multiple terminals/sessions and wants to consolidate insights. There's no emotional content - no frustration indicators (like complaints, profanity expressing anger, or criticism of NeonBrain's work) and no satisfaction markers (like praise, enthusiasm, or approval). The context shows Dougtastic was moving from discussion toward action in the prior exchange, and now is requesting cross-session analysis to inform next steps. This is task-focused communication without sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance. The brevity and imperative form ('see', 'analyze', 'recommend') indicate efficiency-focused communication style rather than emotional response. No rating is appropriate because this is purely operational direction - Dougtastic telling NeonBrain what to do next, not reacting to what NeonBrain has done.

**Minimum Viable "Now" — Build Today:**

| `MEMORY/temporal/today.yaml` | Today's blocks + current state | 10 min |
| `pai now` command | Show current block + context | 30 min |
| SessionStart hook update | Auto-show "Now" on `pai` | 15 min |

**That's it.** Everything else can layer on after this works.
