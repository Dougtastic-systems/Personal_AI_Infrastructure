# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated with unclear UI design

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was trying to access the newly implemented usage panel feature at localhost:5172. NeonBrain built the feature and directed him to click 'the bar at the very top left that says USAGE LIMITS | Max 20x'. However, Dougtastic found this instruction unclear and couldn't get the feature to work despite trying. The frustration stems from poor UX design - the clickable element isn't visually obvious as an interactive component. This reveals a pattern where NeonBrain sometimes prioritizes getting features working functionally but doesn't adequately consider visual affordances and user experience. The interface should have made it immediately clear what is clickable, perhaps through hover states, cursor changes, or more obvious button styling. Dougtastic expects intuitive interfaces where he doesn't need explicit instructions to find basic interactions. For future implementations, NeonBrain should ensure interactive elements have clear visual indicators (hover effects, button-like appearance, cursor pointer) and test the obviousness of UI interactions before considering a feature complete.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Click the bar at the very top left that says "USAGE LIMITS | Max 20x"

🔍 ANALYSIS: Looking at the screenshot, you can see at the **top left corner**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 USAGE LIMITS  Max 20x          Son: 0%  Opus: 60%  ▼ │  ← CLICK THIS ENTIRE BAR
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

It's the thin horizontal bar just below the "Local | Remote" tabs and above "SKILLS: Core | WORKFLOWS: None"
