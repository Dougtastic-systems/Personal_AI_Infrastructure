## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a neutral exploratory question about potentially adding calendar functionality to NeonBrain/PAI. This is not an emotional reaction to NeonBrain's performance, but rather a product/feature consideration question. He's brainstorming where to place calendar functionality after learning PAI doesn't currently have it. The incomplete sentence ('i') suggests he's thinking out loud or got interrupted. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or emotional charge directed at NeonBrain's work - just neutral product planning. This is a design conversation, not feedback on assistant performance.
