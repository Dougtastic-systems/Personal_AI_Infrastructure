## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is giving clear technical directives about next steps: build a file extraction prompt, create an HTML explainer of the design, and test on the 5 most recent emails by send date. He's being strategic about context window management (wants to stay under 50% utilization) and focused on testing with recent data because 'things have changed.' This is pure project management—setting boundaries (context window), requesting documentation (HTML explainer), and defining test parameters (5 most recent by date sent). There's no frustration or satisfaction expressed toward NeonBrain's work; he's simply directing the next phase of development. The tone is business-like and organized, showing Dougtastic thinking systematically about resource constraints and test methodology. This represents collaborative planning rather than feedback on NeonBrain's performance.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Let me clarify exactly what I'm suggesting—there are two distinct approaches and I was conflating them.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

**Two Clear Paths:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PATH A: File-Based Only (Prove Value First)                    │
│                                                                 │
│  Email → LLM Extract → JSON File → Query via Claude/Search      │
│                                                                 │
