## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking NeonBrain to pause and refactor a response before posting it publicly. He's expressing a collaborative concern that the current draft might not align well with Rick's marketing letter style and could fail to be 'additive' to the conversation. The phrase 'looking for working rhythm' suggests he wants to find a better collaborative flow between NeonBrain's output and Rick's communication style. This is a thoughtful, pre-emptive quality check rather than a reaction to something NeonBrain already did wrong. There's no frustration here - just a desire to refine the work to be more complementary to Rick's language before sharing it. This shows Dougtastic treating NeonBrain as a collaborative partner whose output needs editorial alignment, not disappointment with what NeonBrain has done. The sentiment is neutral because it's a proactive request for improvement before action, not a reaction to a mistake.
