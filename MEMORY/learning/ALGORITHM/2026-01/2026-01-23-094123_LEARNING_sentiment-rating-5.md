## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is managing workflow steps for OAuth setup. They've completed the first step of creating OAuth credentials but skipped ahead without creating a test user first. Now they're asking NeonBrain to remind them to return to the test user creation step later. This is pure task management - no frustration or satisfaction expressed toward NeonBrain's assistance. The message is simply coordinating next steps in a multi-step process. There's no emotional valence regarding NeonBrain's performance, suggestions, or help. It's a straightforward workflow note about task ordering.
