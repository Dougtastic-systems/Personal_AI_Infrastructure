# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 2/10

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Rating:** 2/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated by API limit interruption during work

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was actively working on Sprint 7 implementation when NeonBrain suddenly stopped functioning due to API rate limits. This is particularly frustrating because:

1. **What Dougtastic was trying to accomplish**: Continue productive development work on Sprint 7, maintaining momentum on an active task.

2. **What NeonBrain did wrong**: Hit API rate limits mid-session, forcing an abrupt halt to work. The terse "continue" response shows frustration at having to resume after an interruption.

3. **Root cause of frustration**: Unexpected workflow interruption. Dougtastic was in a flow state, and the system failed to maintain continuity. The rate limit message broke concentration and forced context-switching.

4. **Triggering behavior**: The system didn't manage its token budget proactively or warn Dougtastic that limits were approaching. It just stopped working.

5. **What should have happened**: NeonBrain should either (a) manage token usage to avoid mid-session limits, (b) warn when approaching limits so Dougtastic can plan accordingly, or (c) provide graceful degradation rather than hard failure.

6. **Pattern revealed**: Dougtastic expects reliable, continuous assistance during development work. Interruptions for technical reasons (especially ones under the system's control) damage trust and productivity.
