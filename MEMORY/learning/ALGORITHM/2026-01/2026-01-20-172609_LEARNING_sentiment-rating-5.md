## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is providing technical clarifications for Sprint 6 design decisions. He's answering three questions: Q1 choosing 'both option c', Q2 explaining that pipeline visualization should use invocation data rather than recursive reconstruction (directing to use SHOW INVOCATION DETAILS which is simpler for v1), and Q3 agreeing with a previous point. He references historical data stored as CSV. This is purely functional communication - he's making design decisions and providing technical direction. There's no emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's work, just collaborative problem-solving. The tone is matter-of-fact and directive. This is normal back-and-forth during design phase where Dougtastic clarifies requirements and constraints. No frustration or satisfaction is expressed - just clear technical communication about implementation approach.
