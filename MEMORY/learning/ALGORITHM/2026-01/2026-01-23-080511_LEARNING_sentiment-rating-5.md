## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is initiating a UX design review project for the 'now dashboard' - his cognitive command center. He's expressing frustration with the CURRENT design (not with NeonBrain), acknowledging he lacks design vocabulary to articulate what feels wrong. His goal: create a dashboard optimized for his ADHD brain that enables cognitive efficiency - quick signal recognition ('oh, this matters') with ability to drill deeper when oriented. He wants to protect his high-value morning flow state by managing capacity visibility.

This is a collaborative planning request, not feedback on NeonBrain's work. He's asking NeonBrain to help him: 1) develop design language he's missing, 2) analyze the existing UI, 3) iterate toward better solutions, 4) identify what needs tracking/visibility. The tone is exploratory and partnership-oriented ('let's plan this project'). No emotional response to NeonBrain's performance - this is the START of work together, not evaluation of completed work. His excitement is about the PROJECT possibility, not about anything NeonBrain has done yet. This represents Dougtastic's typical pattern of deep thinking-out-loud to frame complex problems before diving in.
