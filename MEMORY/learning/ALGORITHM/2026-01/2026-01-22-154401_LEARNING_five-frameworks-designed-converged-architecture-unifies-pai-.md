✅ RESULTS: Complete convergence achieved.

## THE UNIFIED INSIGHT

**One architecture serves ALL scales:**

```
LIFE (TELOS goals)
  └── PROJECT (continuations)
       └── SESSION (work session / xConnect investigation)
            └── TASK (specific work / hypothesis)
                 └── MICRO (current step / query)
```

## UNIVERSAL WORK ITEM

Everything shares the same schema:
- A life goal
- A PAI project
- An xConnect investigation  
- A SQL query
- A pipeline step

**All have:** state, priority, time, context, dependencies

## THE "NOW" INTERFACE (Same everywhere)

```
⏰ 2:34pm                    ████████░░ 86 min left

🎯 NOW: OHR6 Level Investigation
   Context: Life > xConnect Build > IDE Dev > Testing
   You were: Hypothesis H2 - checking first-gen counts
   Next step: Run validation query

   [ Continue ]     [ Switch ]     [ Break ]
```

**Works identically for:**
- PAI session start → "Work on xConnect IDE"
- xConnect IDE → "Investigate OHR6 levels"
- CLI → `$ now`

## COMPLETE FRAMEWORK CATALOG

| Framework | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Investigation Workflow** | 7 principles, 5-phase lifecycle | ✅ Designed |
| **Development Lifecycle** | Planning, architecture, TDD, refactoring, scheduling, prioritization | ✅ Designed |
| **Documentation Process** | Reverse engineering, multi-audience translation | ✅ Designed |
| **Prod-Only Development** | Change ledger, safe change protocol, code-as-docs | ✅ Designed |
| **Temporal Coordination** | NOW layer, context stack, decision engine | ✅ Designed |

📊 STATUS: All architectural components designed. Ready for consolidation.

📁 CAPTURE:
- Universal Work Item schema works from life goals to SQL queries
- Nested Context model enables save/restore at any level
- Decision Engine answers "what now?" with ONE suggestion
- Same interface serves PAI and xConnect
- 4-phase integration plan: Core → PAI → xConnect → Advanced

➡️ NEXT:
1. **Consolidate** all frameworks into one PRODUCTION-WORK-FRAMEWORK.md?
2. **Create** the temporal/ directory structure?
3. **Implement** the NOW interface (CLI first)?
4. **Start** Phase 1 (work item schema, context model)?

📖 STORY EXPLANATION:
1. Started with xConnect needing production work definition
2. Discovered missing development lifecycle processes beyond investigation
3. Added planning, architecture, TDD, refactoring, scheduling, prioritization
4. Added reverse engineering and multi-audience documentation
5. Adapted everything for your no-git, prod-only reality
6. Converged with PAI temporal coordination - same problem at different scales
7. Created universal work item model serving all scales of work
8. Single NOW interface answers "what should I work on?" everywhere
