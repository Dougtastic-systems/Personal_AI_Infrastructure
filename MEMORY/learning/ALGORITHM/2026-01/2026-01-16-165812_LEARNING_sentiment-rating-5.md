## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about whether to expand browser extension development beyond Firefox to Safari and Chrome. This is a planning/decision-making question, not expressing satisfaction or frustration with NeonBrain's performance. The question shows Dougtastic is thinking about next steps after completing the Firefox extension, but contains no emotional indicators about NeonBrain's work. The tone is casual and inquisitive ('Do they even have extensions for those ones?'), indicating genuine uncertainty about browser extension ecosystems rather than any sentiment toward the AI assistant. This is purely a technical consultation moment with no feedback on NeonBrain's previous responses or actions.
