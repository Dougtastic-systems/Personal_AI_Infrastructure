# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is following a multi-step technical setup process (enabling APIs, creating OAuth credentials). He has completed the first step (enabling APIs) and is now asking for instructions on the next step (creating OAuth credentials). This is a straightforward procedural question with no emotional content directed at NeonBrain. The phrase 'I have not done that yet' is a simple status update, and 'how do I do it?' is a direct request for guidance. There's no indication of frustration (like 'I don't know how' or 'this is confusing') nor satisfaction. This is task-oriented communication typical of following technical instructions. No rating is appropriate because this is purely informational exchange with no sentiment about NeonBrain's performance or assistance quality.
