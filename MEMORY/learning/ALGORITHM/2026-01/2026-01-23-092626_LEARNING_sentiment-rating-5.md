## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is issuing a straightforward command to set up a centralized credentials folder for OAuth management. This is a continuation of the technical discussion about Gmail authentication and organizing OAuth credentials for multiple projects. There's no emotional content directed at NeonBrain - this is simply the next logical step in the workflow. The message is matter-of-fact and task-oriented. Dougtastic appears to be following through on the plan to organize OAuth credentials properly, showing engagement with the task but no particular sentiment about NeonBrain's performance. This is standard project setup work with no indicators of frustration, satisfaction, or any emotion related to the AI assistant's responses or actions.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: OAuth credentials location for Gmail integration.

**Current location:**
```
~/.claude/skills/_NATE/tools/gmail-credentials.json
```

**But for reuse across projects**, it should probably live in a central location. I'd suggest:

```
~/.claude/credentials/google/
├── gmail-credentials.json    # OAuth client config (from Google Cloud)
├── gmail-tokens.json         # Access/refresh tokens (generated by auth)
└── README.md                 # Setup notes
```

Then update the auth scripts
