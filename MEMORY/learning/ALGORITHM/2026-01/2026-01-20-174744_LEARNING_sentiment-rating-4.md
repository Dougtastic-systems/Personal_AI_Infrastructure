## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was attempting to start the Claude agent system. After typing 'claude+[enter]' and confirming trust with 'yes', he expected the system to launch into an interactive mode ready for commands. Instead, NeonBrain displayed what appears to be a status screen with a suggestion to 'Try "fix typecheck errors"' and various metrics (PAI v2.3 statusline, context usage, learning signals, etc.).

The frustration stems from unclear UX - Dougtastic likely expected either: (a) a clear prompt asking what he wants to do, or (b) immediate action. Instead, he got a data-heavy status display that doesn't clearly communicate 'what now?' The tone of presenting this screen without context suggests NeonBrain assumed Dougtastic would understand what to do next, but the lack of clear next steps created confusion.

What NeonBrain should have done: After the trust confirmation, either (1) display a brief welcome message explaining the status display and how to proceed, or (2) skip the status screen entirely and go straight to an interactive prompt like 'What would you like me to help with?' The current behavior feels like being dropped into the middle of a system without orientation, which creates mild frustration even though the system itself may be working as designed.
