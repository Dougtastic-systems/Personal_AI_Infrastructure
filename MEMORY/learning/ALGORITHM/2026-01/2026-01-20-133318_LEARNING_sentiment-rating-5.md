## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic issued a straightforward operational directive to check token usage estimates before proceeding with the next sprint. This is a practical, technical instruction with no emotional indicators. The message shows responsible resource management - Dougtastic is being proactive about monitoring token consumption to avoid budget overruns or unexpected costs. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or any sentiment directed toward NeonBrain's performance. This is simply part of normal workflow management. The context of this coming after a sprint completion and task notification suggests good project hygiene - pause, assess resources, then proceed. No behavioral patterns to note regarding NeonBrain's performance, just standard operational oversight. This type of message should not trigger sentiment tracking as it's purely functional communication about resource monitoring.
