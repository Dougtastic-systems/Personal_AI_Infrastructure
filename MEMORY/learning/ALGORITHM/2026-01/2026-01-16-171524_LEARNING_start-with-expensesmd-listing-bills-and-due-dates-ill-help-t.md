## The Simple Version

**The problem:** You don't know what bills are due when, what you spend, or where you stand.

**The solution:** Write it down ONCE, then I help you manage it.

---

## How It Actually Works

### Step 1: Visibility (The Hardest Part)
You fill out the files with what you know. Even rough guesses are better than nothing:

| File | What goes in it | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **EXPENSES.md** | Every bill + due date | I can remind you before bills are due |
| **ACCOUNTS.md** | Which accounts you have | Know where money lives |
| **INCOME.md** | When you get paid | Know when money arrives |

### Step 2: I Do the Thinking

Once I know your bills and due dates, I can:
- **"What bills are due this week?"** → I tell you
- **"Do I have enough for rent?"** → I check
- **"What subscriptions am I paying for?"** → I list them
- **"Help me make a plan to catch up"** → We build one together

### Step 3: Gradual Improvement

You don't need perfect data. Start with:
1. List your bills and rough due dates
2. List your income and pay dates
3. That's it. The rest comes later.

## For Your Situation Specifically

Since you're paying bills late, the **killer feature** is EXPENSES.md with due dates:

```markdown
## Fixed Monthly Expenses
| Expense | Amount | Due Date | Category |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Rent | $1500 | 1st | Housing |
| Electric | ~$80 | 15th | Utilities |
| Internet | $65 | 20th | Utilities |
| Phone | $85 | 12th | Utilities |
```

Then you can ask me:
- "What's due in the next 7 days?"
- "Set up a bill calendar for me"
- "Which bills can I push if I'm short this week?"

---

➡️ **NEXT SESSION:** We'll start with just EXPENSES.md - list your bills and when they're due. That alone will change everything.

📖 **STORY EXPLANATION:**
1. The template is just markdown files with your financial info
2. I can read them and answer questions about your money
3. Start with expenses and due dates - that's the pain point
4. Even rough numbers work, perfection not required
5. Once bills are documented, I can remind you proactively
6. Income tracking shows when money comes in
7. Eventually you see the full picture: in vs out
8. The goal is awareness first, optimization later
