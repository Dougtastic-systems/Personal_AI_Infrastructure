## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is engaged in strategic thinking about future tooling and processes, not reacting to anything NeonBrain has done. He's explicitly stating 'I'm not going to try this right now' and asking for organizational framework suggestions around storing and managing HTML artifact sharing solutions. This is forward-looking architectural planning - discussing how to reduce friction in collaboration, where to store reusable patterns, and what framework to build around them. There's no emotional reaction to NeonBrain's performance here; instead, Dougtastic is using NeonBrain as a thought partner to develop a methodology. The request for 'suggestions, framework, questions' indicates he wants collaborative input on system design. No indicators of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with NeonBrain's work - just neutral strategic planning. This type of message shouldn't trigger sentiment tracking as it's about future state planning rather than reaction to current AI performance.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Evaluating WhatsApp and Google Docs as immediate sharing options for interactive HTML.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

## WhatsApp

**Can you attach HTML?** Yes, but it won't render interactively.
- WhatsApp treats `.html` files as generic file attachments
- Recipient downloads → opens in phone/desktop browser
- **Works**, but clunky on mobile (browser switching)

**Better WhatsApp approach:** Share a link (CodePen, etc.) - tapping a link is frictionless

## Google Docs

**Pasting HTML directly?** No
