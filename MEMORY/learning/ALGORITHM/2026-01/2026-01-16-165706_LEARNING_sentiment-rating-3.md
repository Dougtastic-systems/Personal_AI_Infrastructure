# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Rating:** 3/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated by unclear instructions from NeonBrain

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was trying to set up 1Password CLI integration and encountered confusing instructions from NeonBrain. The assistant provided incomplete guidance that got cut off mid-sentence ('Make...'), leaving Dougtastic uncertain about what to do. When Dougtastic expressed confusion ('I don't understand instructions'), NeonBrain acknowledged the problem and tried to restart with clearer instructions. However, Dougtastic's follow-up 'I think I completed all steps' suggests continued uncertainty - they're not confident they did it right. The root frustration is NeonBrain's initial poor communication - cutting off instructions mid-word is a basic failure. This reveals Dougtastic expects clear, complete, step-by-step guidance for technical tasks. NeonBrain should have: (1) provided complete instructions initially, (2) used numbered lists with exact button names/locations, (3) included verification steps so Dougtastic could confirm success. The 'I think' phrasing indicates lingering doubt about whether the task was completed correctly, suggesting NeonBrain still hasn't fully resolved the confusion.
