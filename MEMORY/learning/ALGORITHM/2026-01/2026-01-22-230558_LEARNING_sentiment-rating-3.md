## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic expected to see the server running after NeonBrain's recent work, but it's not visible to him. The frustration is mild but clear - he's not seeing the expected result of the task that was just completed. NeonBrain apparently made changes to add fallback Oura data handling and completed background task cleanup, but Dougtastic can't observe the server actually running. The typo 'breifing' and casual tone 'I'm not seeing the server' suggests mild annoyance rather than anger. He's redirecting to a different task (tomorrow's briefing) rather than dwelling on the issue. The root cause is likely a disconnect between what NeonBrain reported as 'completed' and what Dougtastic can actually see running. NeonBrain should have either: (1) verified the server was actually visible/accessible before reporting completion, (2) provided explicit instructions on how to view/access the server, or (3) clearly stated if the server needed to be manually started. The 'show me' phrasing suggests Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to have direct visibility into system state.
