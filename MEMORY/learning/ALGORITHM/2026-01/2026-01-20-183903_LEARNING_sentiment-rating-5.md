## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is issuing a testing command to verify the scrolling functionality that was just fixed. This is a neutral technical instruction following the fix of removing 'overflow: hidden' from panel CSS. The message contains no emotional indicators - it's simply directing NeonBrain to test/demonstrate the scrolling feature in the SHOW STEP view. The lowercase format and brevity suggest casual communication style but doesn't indicate satisfaction or dissatisfaction. This is purely functional communication to validate the recent fix. No sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance is expressed here - Dougtastic is just moving forward with testing the implemented solution.
