## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about where recipe card workflow files are stored so he can examine them individually. This is a neutral, task-oriented query with no emotional indicators toward NeonBrain's previous work. The question suggests Dougtastic wants to understand the file structure better, which is a normal part of working with the system. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or any other sentiment directed at NeonBrain's assistance - it's simply a request for information to enable the next step in his workflow. The tone is direct and practical, focused on accomplishing a task rather than evaluating NeonBrain's performance.
