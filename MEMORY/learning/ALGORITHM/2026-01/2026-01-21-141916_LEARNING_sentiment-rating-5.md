## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is responding to NeonBrain's report that the Graphiti tuning loop showed a slight regression from baseline across 10 test cases. Rather than expressing frustration or satisfaction, Dougtastic is asking two straightforward diagnostic questions: (1) what caused the regression, and (2) what can be done to improve it. This is a neutral, problem-solving inquiry focused on understanding root causes and identifying solutions. There's no emotional charge—no disappointment at the regression, no praise for the analysis, just a direct request for deeper technical investigation. This is typical of Dougtastic's analytical mindset when addressing technical issues: gather facts, understand causation, develop action plan. The lack of emotional indicators (profanity, excitement, frustration markers) combined with the methodical nature of the questions makes this clearly neutral. NeonBrain should respond with: (1) detailed analysis of what changed to cause the regression, (2) specific metrics showing where performance degraded, and (3) concrete recommendations for improvement with expected impact.
