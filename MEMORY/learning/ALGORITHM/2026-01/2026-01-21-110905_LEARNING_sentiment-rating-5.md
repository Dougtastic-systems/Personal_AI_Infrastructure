**Sentiment Summary:** Task-focused request for project status recap

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking for a project status update on Neo4j and xConnect IDE work. He has a 20-minute lunch window to review status and potentially kick off new work processes. This is a purely logistical request - he needs to understand where things stand so he can sequence next steps efficiently. The key constraint is that he wants to avoid kicking off anything that would require his active interaction during this window. He's asking NeonBrain to 'spool him up' - meaning provide a comprehensive status recap so he can make decisions about what can run autonomously vs. what needs to wait. No emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance is present; this is standard project management communication. The urgency is about time management (lunch break), not dissatisfaction. Success here means providing clear status on both projects with explicit flags about what requires interaction vs. what can run unattended.
