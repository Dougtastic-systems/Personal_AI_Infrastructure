## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is issuing a straightforward command to commit code changes and prepare a future prompt for the Architect agent to perform a deep dive analysis. This is a neutral project management instruction without emotional indicators. The context shows a successful completion of an Architect analysis (530-line architecture doc), and Dougtastic is now moving to the next logical step: committing the work and queueing the next task.

The message functions as a workflow command rather than feedback on NeonBrain's capabilities or execution quality.
