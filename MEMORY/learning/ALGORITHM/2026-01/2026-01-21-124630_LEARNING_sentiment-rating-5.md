## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about validating the Capture-to-Graph pipeline. He wants to know if source inputs match outputs and is seeking testing strategies. This is a neutral inquiry focused on quality assurance - there's no emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance, just a request for analysis and methodology. The question shows Dougtastic is engaged in the technical work and thinking critically about validation, but isn't expressing satisfaction or frustration with what NeonBrain has done. It's a collaborative, exploratory question rather than a reaction to NeonBrain's work quality.
