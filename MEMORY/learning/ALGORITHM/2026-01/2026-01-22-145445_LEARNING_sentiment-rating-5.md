## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is providing a status update and organizing their workflow. They've completed testing and made observations that lead to proposed design changes. However, rather than jumping into changes immediately, they want to stabilize the current state first - understanding what's known and planned before incorporating new changes. The key insight is 'I need to get to using this which will expose the real requirements' - indicating a pragmatic approach to discover actual needs through usage rather than theoretical design.

This is a neutral project management statement with no emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's work. It's Dougtastic thinking through their process: test → observe → plan → stabilize → then change. The message shows good engineering discipline (don't change everything at once) and practical wisdom (real usage reveals real requirements).

No rating is warranted because this isn't expressing satisfaction or frustration with NeonBrain's assistance - it's Dougtastic organizing their own thoughts and communicating their approach to the next phase of work.
