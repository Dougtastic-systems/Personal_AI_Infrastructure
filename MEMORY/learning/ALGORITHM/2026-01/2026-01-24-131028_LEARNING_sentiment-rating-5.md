## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about whether NeonBrain can display context usage for Gemini and OpenAI models, similar to how it's currently showing Claude usage. The context shows they just confirmed the dashboard is working correctly for Claude's usage limits (43% 5-hour, 6% weekly). This appears to be a natural follow-up question - since the feature works well for Claude, they're curious if it extends to other AI providers. There's no emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain; this is simply an inquiry about expanding functionality. The typo ('thee' instead of 'the') is likely just a quick typing error and doesn't indicate frustration. This is a constructive question about feature discovery, not feedback on NeonBrain's performance.
