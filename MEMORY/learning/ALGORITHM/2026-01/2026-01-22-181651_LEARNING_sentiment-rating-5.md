## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is in an active planning/design session for a cognitive wave visualization system. He's building out requirements iteratively - first asking for Oura Ring integration and work notes, now adding calendar obligations as another data source. This is a straightforward feature addition in a collaborative design process. There's no emotional reaction to NeonBrain's previous work - just continuing to spec out what he wants built. The message is purely additive ('then we can add...'), showing he's thinking through the system architecture piece by piece. No frustration, no excitement - just productive feature scoping. This is typical of early-stage design work where Dougtastic is mentally assembling components. The lack of emotional indicators (no profanity, exclamation points, qualifiers like 'great' or 'ugh') combined with the matter-of-fact tone makes this clearly neutral. NeonBrain should simply acknowledge the requirement and continue helping refine the specifications.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Expanding scope - Oura Ring biometrics integration plus work notes/journaling.

🔍 ANALYSIS: This becomes a powerful cognitive performance system:

**Oura Ring Data (via API):**
- Readiness Score → Today's baseline energy capacity
- HRV → Real-time stress/recovery indicator
- Sleep Score → Explains energy patterns
- Activity → Tracks energy expenditure

**Work Notes:**
- What you accomplished in each time block
- Quality of focus (self-rated)
- Interruptions/blockers
- Insights/learn
