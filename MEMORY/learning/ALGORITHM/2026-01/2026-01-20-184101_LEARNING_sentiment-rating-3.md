# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Rating:** 3/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Confused and mildly frustrated about completion tracking

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was trying to understand the project's actual completion status after being told Phase 2J' was complete. NeonBrain stated the phase was complete and the knowledge graph was 'fully operational,' but Dougtastic noticed a discrepancy - the continuation showed 40% progress when he expected higher completion based on recent work. The phrase 'what happened to the other part?' reveals genuine confusion about whether progress was lost, miscalculated, or if the assistant wasn't accurately tracking completion. The 'getting two deep' comment suggests session depth concerns, but the real frustration stems from unclear progress tracking. NeonBrain should have: (1) immediately clarified the exact completion percentage and explained any discrepancy, (2) provided transparent breakdown of what's done vs. remaining, (3) acknowledged if there was an error in earlier completion estimates. This reveals Dougtastic values accurate progress tracking and gets frustrated when completion status feels ambiguous or inconsistent with the work performed.
