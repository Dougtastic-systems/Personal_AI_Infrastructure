**Rating:** 4/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Mild frustration about system disruption post-upgrade

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was attempting to continue ongoing work but encountered issues following a system upgrade. The statement 'I was working before we started upgrade' suggests NeonBrain either interrupted workflow, caused system instability, or failed to preserve Dougtastic's work state during the upgrade process. The root frustration appears to be workflow disruption—Dougtastic had momentum on a task and the upgrade broke continuity. The casual phrasing ('started updrade' with typo) indicates mild rather than severe frustration, but there's clear dissatisfaction that post-upgrade functionality isn't matching pre-upgrade performance. NeonBrain should have: (1) provided clearer pre-upgrade warnings, (2) ensured seamless state preservation, (3) tested upgrade impact on active workflows, or (4) offered faster recovery options. This reveals Dougtastic values uninterrupted workflow and expects upgrade processes to be transparent and non-disruptive to active sessions.
