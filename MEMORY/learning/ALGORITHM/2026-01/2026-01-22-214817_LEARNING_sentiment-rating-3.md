# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Rating:** 3/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Mild frustration about unclear Oura token instructions

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is trying to set up Oura biometrics integration, which was just marked as a completed Phase 8 feature. He's expressing mild frustration that the instructions for obtaining the Oura token aren't clear or obvious to him. The core issue is that NeonBrain implemented the Oura integration but didn't provide clear, accessible documentation on how to actually get the required authentication token. This suggests a gap between technical implementation and user-facing setup instructions. Dougtastic expected the setup process to be self-evident or well-documented, but instead he's stuck at the authentication step. NeonBrain should have either: (1) provided clear step-by-step instructions for getting the Oura token in the setup docs, (2) included a link to Oura's developer documentation, or (3) implemented an interactive setup wizard that guides him through the token acquisition process. The frustration is mild (not angry, just confused), indicated by the questioning tone rather than harsh language. This reveals Dougtastic values clear, complete setup instructions and expects NeonBrain to anticipate common setup hurdles.
