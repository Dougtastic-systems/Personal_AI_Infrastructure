# Quick Learning: Adding strategic assertions with implications and six practices with three to four sub-points each.

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Auto-captured:** Yes (use /capture-learning for detailed narrative)

## Summary

Good catches—adding a "practices" section with sub-points and strengthening the assertions to be more strategic/thesis-driven.

📋 SUMMARY: Good catches—adding a "practices" section with sub-points and strengthening the assertions to be more strategic/thesis-driven.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

**What you're asking for:**

1. **Strategic Assertions** — Nate's thesis-level claims (Seth Godin style: "Here's what I believe is true")
2. **Practices with Sub-Points** — The 6 explicit practices, each with 3-4 key points from what he actually wrote

**Proposed new sections:**

```json
"strategic_assertions": [
  {
    "assertion": "Raw capability stopped being the bottleneck",
    "implication": "Optimizing for better prompting is solving the wrong problem",
    "constraint": "The new constraint is cognitive architecture—how much you can concurrently think sensibly about"
  },
  {
    "assertion": "The stable altitude of abstraction we've operated at for decades is disrupted",
    "implication": "We need to go lower AND higher than we've ever operated",
    "constraint": "This is what's stressing everyone out—not that AI is too dumb or too smart"
  },
  {
    "assertion": "Coding agents succeeded where general agents failed",
    "implication": "Constrained, text-based environments with immediate feedback work; ambiguous real-world interfaces don't",
    "constraint": "The Year of the Agent became the Decade of the Agent"
  }
],

"practices": [
  {
    "number": 1,
    "title": "Adopt the Engineering Manager Identity",
    "core_idea": "Not metaphorically. Operationally.",
    "key_points": [
      "An engineer's job is to write code. An engineering manager's job is to ensure their team produces valuable output. The skills are different.",
      "You're managing agents that are stateless, tireless, and prone to confident incorrectness—requires specific discipline.",
      "Steve Yegge's Gas Town documents the progression: Stage 5 is single agent YOLO, Stage 7 is 10+ hand-managed, Stage 8 is building your own orchestrator.",
      "The hardest part is letting go of the identity that got you here. It feels like loss but it's leverage."
    ]
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "title": "Kill the Contribution Badge",
    "core_idea": "Stop doing pre-thinking work as a badge of honor",
    "key_points": [
      "The instinct to 'bring something comprehensive' before engaging AI is costing you throughput.",
      "Your 'comprehensive thought' is often premature structure that closes off better solutions.",
      "This habit is a hangover from early 2025 models—you had to do cleanup or the model would go on tangents. Models got better; habits didn't update.",
      "The practice: start talking before you think you're ready. Ramble. Let the tool help you find your intent."
    ]
  },
  {
    "number": 3,
    "title": "Develop Strategic Deep-Diving Capability",
    "core_idea": "The ability to deliberately change altitude",
    "key_points": [
      "Neither 'understand every line' nor 'accept code you don't understand' works at scale.",
      "The worst vibe coders stay permanently high—ship without understanding, create 'archaeological programming'.",
      "The worst traditional developers stay permanently low—review every line, throughput hits a ceiling.",
      "Drop altitude where you can verify reality against expectation—authentication flows, database schemas, edge cases that matter. Then climb back out."
    ]
  },
  {
    "number": 4,
    "title": "Create Temporal Separation",
    "core_idea": "Build on Tuesday. Reflect on Friday.",
    "key_points": [
      "Building and reflecting require different brain chemistry—you need temporal separation between generative and evaluative states.",
      "One builder put Sentry on a personal project not for observability but to create artifacts for his future reflecting self.",
      "'Write drunk, edit sober' adapted for AI work—you can't do strategic thinking while plate-spinning in flow state.",
      "The reflection sessions most builders skip are the difference between getting faster and getting better."
    ]
  },
  {
    "number": 5,
    "title": "Distinguish Two Kinds of Architecture",
    "core_idea": "Civil engineering patterns vs. 'the quality without a name'",
    "key_points": [
      "First kind: patterns you put in Claude.md files. How problems should be solved consistently. Agents excel at this.",
      "Second kind: Christopher Alexander's 'quality without a name'—what makes Paris feel better than Cincinnati. This is taste, coherence, vision.",
      "Nobody's figured out how to outsource the second kind. That's where your attention needs to go.",
      "When it's civil engineering, lean hard on agents. When it's the quality without a name, that's you."
    ]
  },
  {
    "number": 6,
    "title": "Accept That Experience Is Not Compressible",
    "core_idea": "Software development is also personal transformation",
    "key_points": [
      "You can build overnight but you don't have operator's knowledge—you don't know where the nooks and crannies are.",
      "The vision you have for a product is often fundamentally wrong. The stepwise process of building reveals what you actually want.",
      "If you could instantly manifest your vision, you'd miss the discoveries that reveal what you actually want to build.",
      "You can build fast AND ensure you're experiencing each version—but it requires actually using what you ship, not just shipping it."
    ]
