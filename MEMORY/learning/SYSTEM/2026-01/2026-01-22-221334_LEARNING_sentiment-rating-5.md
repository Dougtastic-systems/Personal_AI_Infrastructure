## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is in the middle of setting up OAuth credentials through the Oura Developer Portal and has encountered a form asking for Website URL and Terms of Service URL. This is a straightforward technical question seeking guidance on what values to input for these required fields. There's no emotional sentiment directed at NeonBrain - he's simply asking for help navigating a configuration step. The question indicates he's actively following instructions and has made progress to the OAuth app creation form, but needs clarification on these specific fields. This is a normal part of the setup process and represents collaborative problem-solving rather than any expression of satisfaction or frustration with NeonBrain's assistance. The tone is matter-of-fact and task-focused.
