## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is working through OAuth credential setup and encountered a navigation issue - they don't know how to get back to the test user email section in what appears to be a Google/OAuth configuration interface. This is a straightforward technical question during a multi-step setup process. There's no frustration evident in the phrasing - just a simple statement of being lost in the UI. The lowercase text and lack of punctuation suggest casual typing, not emotional distress. This is purely informational: Dougtastic needs help finding their way in an interface. NeonBrain should respond with clear navigation instructions. This isn't about NeonBrain's performance - it's about Dougtastic needing guidance in a third-party interface they're unfamiliar with.
