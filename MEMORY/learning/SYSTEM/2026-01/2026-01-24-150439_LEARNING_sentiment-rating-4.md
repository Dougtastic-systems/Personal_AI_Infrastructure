**Sentiment Summary:** Mild frustration with broken terminal counter feature

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was attempting to monitor context token usage via the terminal context counter—a feature NeonBrain should be displaying to track remaining budget during operations. The counter is malfunctioning, showing 0% across multiple terminal instances, preventing Dougtastic from accurately gauging available resources. This is frustrating because: (1) the feature was apparently working in the system validation, (2) it's showing identical broken behavior across separate terminal sessions, suggesting a systemic issue rather than isolated glitch, and (3) without accurate context tracking, Dougtastic cannot properly manage token budget during development work. The root cause appears to be either a display bug in the counter logic or a disconnection between the actual token budget tracker and the terminal UI element. NeonBrain should have: either fixed the counter before validation completed, or provided a workaround to check budget status. The expected behavior is a dynamic percentage display that updates as tokens are consumed, helping Dougtastic manage interactions strategically.
