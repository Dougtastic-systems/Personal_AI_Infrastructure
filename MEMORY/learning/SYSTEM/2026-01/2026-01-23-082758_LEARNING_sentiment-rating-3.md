## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic shared a Fathom call link expecting NeonBrain to analyze it for the Renify marketing project. When NeonBrain stated it couldn't access the link due to authentication, Dougtastic responded with 'don't we have access to front end Fathom?' - the phrasing suggests disappointment that a capability he thought existed doesn't work. The frustration isn't intense (no profanity, no caps), but the rhetorical 'don't we' implies an expectation gap. He's trying to efficiently start a marketing planning project by sharing call context, and hitting an unexpected blocker disrupts his workflow. NeonBrain should have either: (1) Actually checked if Fathom API credentials exist in the system before claiming inability, or (2) Proactively offered alternatives ('I see you shared a Fathom link - I don't have direct access, but if you can share the transcript or key points, I can help with the marketing plan'). The real issue isn't the limitation itself, but the perception that NeonBrain didn't try or verify before stating a limitation. This reveals Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to actively problem-solve around tool limitations rather than immediately declaring inability.
