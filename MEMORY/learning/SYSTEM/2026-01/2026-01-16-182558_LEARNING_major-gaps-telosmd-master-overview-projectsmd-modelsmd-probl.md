## Current Status

- **Complete:** 6 files (ABOUTME, MISSION, GOALS, CHALLENGES, BELIEFS, STRATEGIES)

## Next Steps

Highest impact would be populating TELOS.md (master overview), PROJECTS.md, MODELS.md, and PROBLEMS.md—you have strong memory data for all of these.

🔍 ANALYSIS: Comparing your populated files vs. Daniel's template structure reveals several gaps.

## Major Gaps in Your Documentation

### 1. **TELOS.md (Master Overview) - NOT POPULATED**
Daniel's template has a master `TELOS.md` file that consolidates ALL sections in one place. You have individual files but no master overview. This is the single document that gives the full picture at a glance.

### 2. **BASICINFO.md - NOT POPULATED**
You have ABOUTME.md with good detail, but BASICINFO.md is a quick-reference file for:
- Preferred name/nickname
- Social handles (GitHub, Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- Date/time format preferences
- Currency/unit preferences
- Default paths
- Frequently used commands

### 3. **Missing TELOS Files (Unpopulated Templates)**

| File | Purpose | Your Memory Has Data For This? |
|------|---------|-------------------------------|
| `PROJECTS.md` | Active project tracking with status, blockers, next actions | Yes - PAI, Neon Brain, Cydcor, SRC pilot |
| `MODELS.md` | Mental models (MO#) | Yes - Hook vs Ecosystem, Owner's Manual, Experiment Currency |
| `NARRATIVES.md` | Elevator pitches, talking points (N#) | Partially - "systems beat willpower", "pilot-test-prove" |
| `FRAMES.md` | Perspective lenses (FR#) | Yes - Reframing (churn → talent flow, training → field capital) |
| `PROBLEMS.md` | World problems you're solving (P#) | Yes - Productivity porn, ADHD challenges, organizational learning waste |
| `IDEAS.md` | Ideas to explore (I#) | Yes - CoworkBridge options, elliptical learning loops |
| `TRAUMAS.md` | Formative experiences (TR#) | Minimal data in memory |
| `LEARNED.md` | Hard-won lessons | Yes - Zoom AI unreliability, systems beat willpower |
| `WISDOM.md` | Collected insights | Partially |
| `WRONG.md` | Things you've been wrong about | Yes - started in BELIEFS.md change log |
| `PREDICTIONS.md` | Future predictions with confidence levels | Minimal |
| `BOOKS.md` | Influential books | No data in memory |
| `MOVIES.md` | Influential films | No data in memory |
| `STATUS.md` | Current state snapshot | Could be derived from GOALS.md |

### 4. **Cross-Reference Consistency**
Your populated files have good M→G→C→S mappings, but Daniel's format expects P# (Problems) to inform G# (Goals). Your PROBLEMS.md is empty, breaking this chain.

### 5. **Non-TELOS USER Files (Unpopulated)**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TECHSTACKPREFERENCES.md` | Languages, frameworks, tools, deployment preferences |
| `CONTACTS.md` | Work and personal contacts (Rick is mentioned in memory) |
| `DAIDENTITY.md` | NeonBrain's personality and voice configuration |
| `PRODUCTIVITY.md` | Work habits, focus preferences |
| `REMINDERS.md` | Standing reminders and alerts |
| `RESUME.md` | Professional background |
| `CORECONTENT.md` | Published work catalog |
| `DEFINITIONS.md` | Domain-specific definitions (EFT, xSQL, Owner's Manual) |
| `ASSETMANAGEMENT.md` | Digital assets, domains, sites |

📊 STATUS: 
- **Complete:** 6 files (ABOUTME, MISSION, GOALS, CHALLENGES, BELIEFS, STRATEGIES)
- **Major gaps:** TELOS.md master overview, BASICINFO.md, PROJECTS.md, MODELS.md, PROBLEMS.md, NARRATIVES.md
- **Minor gaps:** FRAMES, IDEAS, LEARNED, WRONG, STATUS
- **No memory data:** BOOKS, MOVIES, TRAUMAS, PREDICTIONS

➡️ NEXT: Highest impact would be populating TELOS.md (master overview), PROJECTS.md, MODELS.md, and PROBLEMS.md—you have strong memory data for all of these.

📖 STORY EXPLANATION:
1. Read Daniel's template files to understand the expected structure
2. Identified TELOS.md master overview is completely unpopulated—key gap
3. Found BASICINFO.md missing quick-reference data like social handles
4. Mapped 12 unpopulated TELOS files against your memory data availability
5. Noted PROJECTS.md is empty despite clear project data in memory
6. Identified MODELS.md gap—you have rich mental model content
7. Found PROBLEMS.md empty, breaking the P→G cross-reference chain
8. Listed non-TELOS USER files that also need attention

⭐ RATE (1-10):

🗣️ NeonBrain: Major gaps: TELOS.md master overview, PROJECTS.md, MODELS.md, PROBLEMS.md—all have memory data available.
