# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Research request about temporal knowledge graphs

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is requesting deep technical research on temporal knowledge graphs and how Graphiti implements them. This is a forward-looking learning request, not feedback on NeonBrain's performance. Dougtastic wants the 'architect' (likely referring to the AI system or himself in planning mode) to understand temporal knowledge graphs deeply, covering: what they are, how they work, what can be steered/configured, limitations, architecture quality, and comparison to Graphiti's GitHub roadmap. The fascination indicates strong interest in this technology for potential AI applications. This is a neutral technical request with no emotional sentiment toward NeonBrain's work - it's a new direction of inquiry. The misspellings ('architct', 'PAI', 'arechitecture', 'thier', 'git up') suggest quick typing from excitement about the topic, but the emotion is about the subject matter (temporal knowledge graphs), not about NeonBrain's performance. This represents Dougtastic seeking to deepen his understanding of a technology he's already working with, showing intellectual curiosity and strategic thinking about AI capabilities.
