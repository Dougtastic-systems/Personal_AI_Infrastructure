## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking for advice on how to answer a description field for a custom GPT called 'VProcessing'. This is a straightforward technical/design question about crafting a concise description for a GPT configuration. There's no emotional content directed at NeonBrain - it's simply a request for assistance with a task in progress. The question shows Dougtastic is actively working on a project (building a custom GPT) and seeking NeonBrain's input on how to handle a specific configuration field. This is routine collaborative work with no frustration or satisfaction expressed about NeonBrain's performance. The tone is matter-of-fact and task-focused. No rating is appropriate because this is purely a neutral request for help, similar to 'Can you check the logs?' or 'What should I name this variable?' - it's process-oriented rather than evaluative of NeonBrain's prior work.
