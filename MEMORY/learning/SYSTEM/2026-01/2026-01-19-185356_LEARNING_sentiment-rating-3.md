## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is trying to process a PDF from a brainstorming session - a routine workflow for him. NeonBrain failed twice by giving the same unhelpful error message without offering concrete solutions. The frustration stems from: (1) Being told to use a 'CLI tool' without being told WHICH tool or HOW to use it, (2) Having his workflow blocked on something that should be straightforward, (3) NeonBrain repeating the same useless response instead of problem-solving. The phrase 'this is a bummer' signals disappointment, and the escalation to 'I don't know what CLI tool. Suggest a solution.' shows mounting frustration at NeonBrain's lack of initiative. What NeonBrain should have done: Immediately suggest specific tools (pdftotext, PyPDF2, etc.), provide the exact command to run, or offer to install and run the tool for him. The pattern revealed: Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to be proactive and solution-oriented, not just identify problems. When NeonBrain blocks his workflow without offering actionable next steps, it creates friction and breaks trust in the assistant's competence.
