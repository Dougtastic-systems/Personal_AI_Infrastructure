## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about how context windows work in terminal mode versus Claude Code Desktop. There's no emotional sentiment directed at NeonBrain - this is purely informational seeking. The question shows Dougtastic is trying to understand the system's limitations and how to work around them effectively. The phrasing 'Please help me understand' is polite and collaborative, not frustrated or impressed. This is a normal learning/clarification moment in their workflow, not a reaction to NeonBrain's performance. While there's an underlying concern about context limits affecting their work, the emotion isn't directed at what NeonBrain has done - it's about understanding the tool's constraints proactively.
