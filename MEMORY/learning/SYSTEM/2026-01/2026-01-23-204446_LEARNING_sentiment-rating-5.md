# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Simple question about API key acquisition

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a straightforward technical question about obtaining an Anthropic API key (referred to colloquially as 'haiku key') following the previous engineering assessment to swap OpenAI with Claude Haiku in Graphiti. This is a neutral, informational query - not expressing any emotion toward NeonBrain's previous work. The question is a natural follow-up to the technical discussion about configuring Graphiti to use Claude Haiku instead of OpenAI. Dougtastic is simply requesting information about the practical next step (obtaining the API key) needed to implement the proposed solution. There's no emotional content, no frustration, no excitement - just a direct question seeking procedural information. This represents standard task progression in a technical workflow rather than any reaction to NeonBrain's performance or capabilities.
