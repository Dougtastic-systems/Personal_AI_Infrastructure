## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is asking a clarifying technical question about how PAI's compaction feature works and expressing a legitimate architectural concern about LLM accuracy during high context usage (near extraction threshold). This is NOT emotional feedback about NeonBrain's performance - it's Dougtastic seeking to understand the system's internal mechanics before proceeding with a large batch operation (117 agents). The concern about LLM mistakes during compaction is a proactive, thoughtful question about system reliability, not a complaint about anything NeonBrain has done. This represents engaged, analytical thinking about the tool's behavior. The phrase 'for my edification' explicitly frames this as a learning moment, not feedback. No rating is warranted because there's no emotional reaction to NeonBrain's work - just technical curiosity and risk assessment before a large operation.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

**Context & Agents - How It Works:**

| Component | Context Usage | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Main conversation | Your 43% (now ~55%) | Grows with each message |
| Background agents (Task) | **Separate context each** | Independent processes |
| Agent results | Minimal footprint | Only summary returns to main |

When I spawn a Task agent, it runs in a **completely separate context windo
