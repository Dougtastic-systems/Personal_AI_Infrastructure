## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is providing a clear continuation plan for the MCP server integration work. This is a straightforward technical instruction with no emotional indicators. He's outlining the next steps (restart Claude Code, verify tools appear, test with a search query) and acknowledging NeonBrain's previous work (MCP server verified, config copied). The tone is matter-of-fact and procedural. There's no frustration about the need for another restart, nor any particular satisfaction - just a neutral acknowledgment of the process. This is typical task continuation dialogue without sentiment toward NeonBrain's performance. The emoji usage (➡️, 🗣️) is organizational rather than emotional.
