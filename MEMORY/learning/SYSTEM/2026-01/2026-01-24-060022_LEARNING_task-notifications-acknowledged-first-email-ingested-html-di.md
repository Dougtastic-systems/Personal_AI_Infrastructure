📋 SUMMARY: Background task notifications received - most were killed, one completed successfully.

🔍 ANALYSIS: 
- Exit code 137 = SIGKILL (tasks I manually killed during debugging)
- **b5f82ad completed** = The OpenAI gpt-4o-mini run with 2000-char chunks (first email: 117 entities, 83 edges)

The HTML flow diagram I created is now open in your browser at:
`/Users/DSnyder/.claude/tools/graphiti-flow.html`

📊 STATUS: 
- First email successfully ingested with OpenAI
- Flow diagram explains the 5 LLM calls per chunk
- Cost/rate limit comparison shows OpenAI is cheapest and most reliable

➡️ NEXT: Would you like to:
1. **Run full batch overnight** with OpenAI
2. **Try Ollama** for local inference (if you have GPU)
3. **Something else** entirely
