## What Questions You Should Be Asking

### Critical Questions About Nate's Framework

**1. The Cognitive Tax Question:**
> "What is PAI currently costing me cognitively that I've normalized?"

- Where are my open loops that PAI should be closing?
- What relationships have cooled because I forgot follow-ups?
- What projects failed in ways I predicted but didn't capture?

**2. The Loop Question:**
> "Is PAI running a LOOP, or am I still the engine?"

Nate's key distinction: *AI inside notes* vs *AI running a loop*
- Does PAI classify/route/surface while I sleep?
- Or does it require my active engagement to function?

**3. The One Behavior Question:**
> "What is the ONE thing PAI asks of me?"

If the answer is more than one thing, PAI is asking too much.

**4. The Trust Decay Question:**
> "When PAI gets something wrong, how do I know? How do I fix it?"

- Are there audit trails I can see?
- Is there a "fix button" equivalent?
- Do I trust PAI's storage enough to stop double-checking?

## Key Points from Nate's System

| Point | Implication for PAI |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Classification is solved** | AI should auto-route 100% of captures—human never decides category |
| **Confidence thresholds** | When AI isn't sure, it should ASK, not guess |
| **Receipts build trust** | Every action should log what it did and why |
| **Daily digests** | <150 words, 3 actions, fits on phone screen |
| **Restart protocol** | 10-min brain dump, don't catch up, resume normal cadence |
| **4 buckets max** | People, Projects, Ideas, Admin—complexity kills |

## What I Need to Know to Power Effective Assessment

### About Your Current PAI Usage

1. **Capture patterns**: How do you typically send information into PAI? CLI only? Voice? Multiple paths?

2. **What breaks**: Where does PAI friction show up? What do you avoid using because it's annoying?

3. **What's stale**: Are there MEMORY/ directories you never look at? Hooks that run but provide no value?

4. **What's missing**: What do you wish PAI would tell you proactively that it doesn't?

5. **Recovery story**: When PAI fails or you abandon it, what does restart look like?

### About Your Goals

6. **The multiplier question**: What expertise/context do you WANT PAI to multiply? Where is your deep knowledge that AI should amplify?

7. **The relationship question**: Are there people PAI should help you track? Follow-ups, contexts, history?

8. **The surfacing question**: What do you want pushed to you daily/weekly that isn't currently?

### Technical Assessment Needs

9. **Hook inventory**: Which hooks actually fire vs. which are dead code?

10. **Output sizing**: Are current outputs (voice, summaries) appropriately sized?

11. **Correction mechanisms**: When something is filed wrong, how hard is it to fix?

📁 CAPTURE: Created comprehensive manifesto synthesizing Nate's 12 principles and 8 building blocks with PAI assessment framework. Document includes:
- Fundamental principles with "why" explanations
- Building block implementations
- PAI-specific assessment questions
- Comparative analysis preparation

➡️ NEXT:
1. **Review manifesto** - Confirm it captures what you need
2. **Answer the questions above** - So I can run a targeted PAI assessment
3. **Choose assessment scope** - Full system or specific subsystem?

📖 STORY EXPLANATION:
1. Nate's newsletter presents 12 design principles distilled from years of second-brain failures
2. The core insight: AI running a LOOP changes everything—system works while you sleep
3. Eight building blocks implement the principles: Drop Box, Sorter, Form, Filing Cabinet, Receipt, Bouncer, Tap on Shoulder, Fix Button
4. Trust is the hidden variable—systems die from eroded trust, not missing features
5. The leverage argument: AI multiplies what you bring; compounding context IS competitive advantage
6. PAI already has many patterns (hooks, MEMORY/, Algorithm) that map to these blocks
7. Gaps likely exist in: confidence scoring, single capture point, proactive surfacing, easy corrections
8. Next step: your answers to key questions enable targeted assessment
