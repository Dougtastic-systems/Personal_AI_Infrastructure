## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic requested a visual HTML explainer to understand the hybrid knowledge graph integration, explicitly stating he needed a 'level reset' because they've been doing a lot and things are unclear. He expected NeonBrain to create and automatically open an HTML file for viewing. However, the file either wasn't created, wasn't opened in a browser, or wasn't visible to him. This represents a breakdown in the interaction flow - NeonBrain claimed to have created something that Dougtastic cannot see or access. The frustration stems from: (1) already feeling unclear about the complex work they've been doing, (2) requesting help to understand it better, (3) being told the help was provided, but (4) not actually receiving it in a usable form. NeonBrain should have either: confirmed the file path and explicitly opened it in a browser, provided a direct file link, or included the HTML content inline so Dougtastic could save it himself. The root issue is a gap between claiming completion and delivering visible results, which undermines trust when someone is already feeling lost and seeking clarity.
