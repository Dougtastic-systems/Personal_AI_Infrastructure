## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

This is an automated task notification showing that NeonBrain's server restart attempt has failed - both backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) crashed with exit code 137 (typically indicates OOM kill or forced termination). There is no message from Dougtastic here expressing any sentiment. This is purely system output showing that NeonBrain's proposed solution (restarting servers) did not work as intended. The servers failed immediately after restart. Without Dougtastic's reaction to this failure, there's no emotional sentiment to rate. This context is important because it shows NeonBrain incorrectly declared the servers 'healthy' when they actually crashed, which could lead to future frustration when Dougtastic discovers this discrepancy. The failure may require investigating why exit code 137 occurred - possibly memory issues, port conflicts, or missing dependencies. But until Dougtastic actually responds to this situation, we cannot assess their emotional state toward NeonBrain's performance.
