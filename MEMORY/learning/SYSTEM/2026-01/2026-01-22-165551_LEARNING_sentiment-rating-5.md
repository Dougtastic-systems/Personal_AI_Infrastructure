## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is questioning whether the current X-Connects IDE-focused implementation provides sufficient visibility across his entire workflow. He recognizes that while X-Connects will handle much of his work, he also does tool building and other tasks that may occur in different contexts. He's asking NeonBrain to help him understand: (1) whether cross-IDE visibility is already planned, (2) if this represents a gap in the current architecture, and (3) whether he should pause Phase 6 to address this or if it's complementary work that can happen later. This isn't frustration with NeonBrain's work - it's a thoughtful architectural concern about scope and completeness. He's essentially asking 'Is the system we're building sufficiently general, or are we inadvertently creating an X-Connects-only solution?' This reveals Dougtastic values holistic visibility and wants to ensure the Decision Engine/temporal coordination work isn't siloed. The 'help me understand' phrasing shows he trusts NeonBrain to clarify the architecture rather than assuming there's a problem.
