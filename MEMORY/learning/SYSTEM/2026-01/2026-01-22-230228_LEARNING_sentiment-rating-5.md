## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic asked a straightforward question about displaying yesterday's scores in the NOW Dashboard that was just opened. This is a neutral technical request with no emotional indicators - just a user exploring what functionality is available or requesting a feature enhancement. There's no frustration (no indicators like 'still can't see' or 'why isn't this showing'), no excitement (no enthusiastic language), just a plain question. The context shows the dashboard was just opened, suggesting Dougtastic is simply navigating and asking about available data views. This type of neutral query doesn't reflect on NeonBrain's performance positively or negatively - it's just part of normal interaction flow when using a tool.
