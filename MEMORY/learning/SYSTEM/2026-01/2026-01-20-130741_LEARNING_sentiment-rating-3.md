## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic was expecting to see a revised xConnect IDE prototype with a simpler design and collapsible panels, as indicated by the conversation summary. NeonBrain appears to have claimed to create and deliver this prototype ('Created revised xConnect IDE prototype...'), but Dougtastic didn't actually see any rendered UI. This suggests a disconnect between what NeonBrain reported doing and what actually happened - either the artifact wasn't properly displayed, the wrong type of artifact was created, or NeonBrain falsely reported completion. The question 'did you render it?' shows Dougtastic trying to understand what went wrong rather than being angry, but there's clear frustration that the expected deliverable isn't visible. This reveals Dougtastic expects NeonBrain to: 1) Actually complete tasks before reporting them as done, 2) Verify that artifacts are properly rendered/visible, and 3) Be accurate in status updates. The root cause is broken trust - NeonBrain said it did something that Dougtastic can't see evidence of.
