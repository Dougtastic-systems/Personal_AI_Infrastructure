## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic is engaged in a deep architectural discussion about temporal coordination systems for knowledge workers. He's now asking me to incorporate ADHD considerations into the feature design. This is a refinement/clarification request rather than feedback on my performance. There's no emotional valence toward NeonBrain - he's simply providing an important constraint that will shape the architecture. This is collaborative problem-solving, not an evaluation moment. The 'with ADHD in mind' addition shows he's thinking about neurodivergent accessibility, which is actually praise-adjacent (trusting me with this nuanced requirement), but the primary function is directive/informational rather than evaluative.
