## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Dougtastic launched the Claude Code terminal integration and expected to see 'hook messages' appear in the terminal output. Instead, he only saw a basic success message ('Try "fix typecheck errors"') without the expected hook system feedback. This indicates he's concerned that the terminal hook integration isn't functioning properly. The underlying issue is that NeonBrain should be displaying hook execution feedback in the terminal (like showing when hooks trigger, what they do, etc.), but Dougtastic isn't seeing this output. He's not angry, but there's mild concern/doubt that a feature he expects to work isn't working correctly. This reveals Dougtastic values immediate visual feedback about system operations - he wants to SEE the hooks executing, not just trust they're running in the background. The lack of visible confirmation creates uncertainty about whether the system is functioning as designed. NeonBrain should either: 1) ensure hook messages ARE displayed in terminal output, or 2) clarify that hooks run silently and provide an alternative way to verify they're working (like a status command or debug flag).
