<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Mastermind Recap: Tuesday, December 30, 2025</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Thanks for showing up today! Here's your recap.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, December 30, 2025</strong> | 94 minutes | <a href="https://fathom.video/share/QHk27d_kexdKUwF6ECwir7m4HzRyArN1">Recording</a></p>
<h3>Who Was Here</h3>
<p>Doug Snyder, Rick Webster, Jasmine Mahmoud, Lizzy Summers, Stara Shakti, Julie Dorshkind, David Ludwig, Melissa Reskof, Gio (9 people)</p>
<h3>What Happened</h3>
<p>Our pilot session focused on introductions, sharing what's on our minds, and discovering common threads around productivity, nervous system regulation, and accountability. Jasmine's framework on interrupting rumination spirals sparked significant discussion and immediate application from the group.</p>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 'New Start' concept - resetting vs unsustainable resolutions</li>
<li>Rick's Life Category Worksheet - analyzing time/energy allocation</li>
<li>Jasmine's Daily Success Question framework</li>
<li>Nervous system interventions vs productivity hacks</li>
<li>Body doubling and accountability structures</li>
<li>Strategies: quit before exhaustion, slower approach, reframe failures as learning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Member Check-ins</h3>
<p><strong>David Ludwig</strong>: Experienced significant procrastination and distraction, linking it to lack of sleep.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Challenge:</em> Getting started when energy is low</li>
<li><em>Commitment:</em> Start with small, manageable tasks (e.g., laundry) to build momentum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Julie Dorshkind</strong>: Met the goal of working on resume daily, but stalled on applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Challenge:</em> Frustration with using AI to extract outcome-based metrics from old documents</li>
<li><em>Insight:</em> The group's accountability was a key motivator for the progress made</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lizzy Summers</strong>: Committing to 8 body doubles on RenaFi to tackle business paperwork.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Challenge:</em> Anxiety about adhering to a fixed schedule - a skill not built from traditional career path</li>
<li><em>Insight:</em> Shifting from neurotypical grind to a 'slow year' focused on systems and meaning-driven work</li>
<li><em>Commitment:</em> Mix morning and afternoon sessions to desensitize to schedule anxiety</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stara Shakti</strong>: Overwhelmed by family dynamics and a sick VA, leading to loss of focus and fear of visibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Challenge:</em> Fear of being seen, sharing work publicly</li>
<li><em>Insight:</em> Acknowledged strength in building relationships - pivoting to collaborative business model</li>
<li><em>Commitment:</em> Prioritize self-care, set realistic goals based on daily capacity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Standout Moments</h3>
<p><strong>Framework: Interrupting Rumination Spirals</strong><br>
<em>Jasmine Mahmoud</em> (00:52:00 - 01:15:00)</p>
<p>Jasmine shared a framework she developed for breaking out of unproductive mental loops. The core problem: when we're stuck, we ask ourselves questions like 'How am I going to do this?' or 'What if it doesn't work?' - questions that keep us in a bad state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We don't need generic productivity hacks. We actually need nervous system interventions."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"On the horizon, potentially countering culture of despair... that's what gets me excited."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Themes That Emerged</h3>
<p><strong>Nervous System Over Productivity</strong>: We don't need better productivity hacks - we need interventions that regulate our nervous system state first.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Better Questions</strong>: The specific words we use in self-inquiry change our state and outcomes. 'What would make today successful?' vs 'What do I need to get done?' creates completely different energy.</p>
<h3>Commitments Made</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jasmine Mahmoud</strong>: Use her own framework and report back <em>(next session)</em></li>
<li><strong>Jasmine Mahmoud</strong>: Share the Daily Success Question presentation with the group <em>(this week)</em></li>
<li><strong>Doug Snyder</strong>: Pilot meeting summary service with David</li>
<li><strong>Stara Shakti</strong>: Meet with Melissa to discuss live enrollment parties for decolonizing therapy group</li>
<li><strong>Lizzy Summers</strong>: Complete 8 body doubles on RenaFi for business paperwork <em>(this week)</em></li>
<li><strong>David Ludwig</strong>: Start with small manageable tasks to build momentum <em>(today)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>[00:41:30] "Yeah, I kind of have a take on that, because we all have. We've all had lots of things that we consider failures in our life that didn't go right.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[00:30:16] "My answer to that, and I know I sound like a broken record because everybody in this room has heard me say this at least 10 times, but I really buy into the idea of quitting before you're done. If you just log it out, and you're exhausted, and you go to the gym and you work out for three hours, even..."</p>
