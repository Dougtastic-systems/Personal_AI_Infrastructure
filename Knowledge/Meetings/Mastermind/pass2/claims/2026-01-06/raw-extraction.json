It was hard in a different way where I was trying to do it for myself for once, instead of this perfunctory, I got to do this, that some magic will happen that I'll be validated, kind of like, oh, what actually happened, what am I going to do next based on that, and that was a harder, different evolution, but yet more rewarding, and I found myself procrastinating, so kind of getting clear around what that's around. Some of it was, oh, I got to do this thing about myself. Part of it, it's a hard job to go back and do all this forensics because the disjointed saving of what happened, right? I didn't have a narrative that was updated over time to go, oh, this is what happened. So trying to figure that out. And I also think there was a lot of times where I was not in a safe space. Like, I was still activated from a bunch of other things to be able to be calm to actually look at it. So just noticing that part of my avoidance. So procrastination really was a signal that I wasn't taking care of myself. I needed to kind of finally relax and I could look at it and not be tapping into any fear stuff. Like, oh, I'd be looking at something and I should have done something better. So I tried to treat it as that instead of, oh, that thing that sucks again.",

And if you're noting anything on your, on your review, if anything's a surprise, then it's going to get it. You Then that's going to count against you. And anybody beyond your direct manager is only going to just know what they, what you've been communicating out to them. So, you know, anything from your skip level on up is going to be somewhat oblivious to your individual contributions, unless you're standing out. So, are performance reviews, is really good in 2026 is what I would say.",

I also said, who's this really for? Right. And before it was a performative, somehow I'll say something magic that will make up for that screw up that I'm still, you know, mad about versus that exact thing. Like what has my boss been saying? What is his real expectation? And how is this ammunition? is this ammunition? It's for him to continue championing me, and to be clear, I'm in a new to me but wonderful place where my boss is a giant champion and has done many things to help me slow down, focus, adjust my work schedule, and he's been telling me that I'm doing great, and in fact, he's upgraded me several times on my reviews to get top marks across the board, which that only sticks if C-levels approve, and they're very resistant to having people get top marks, so part of the pressure was honoring what he's been saying, so actually that was in there, and that was hard, because it's like, I don't feel like that, because I know all the sausage was made, and the failures, and I could have done better, instead of, he's positioning us, me and him, to do something next, and he's been saying this, this message, and I need We needed to factor through that way, too, which was uncomfortable writing. So, Richard, you really tapped into probably a key aspect that was different than the dread and performative part and that question of is it really necessary or is this connect with what has been saying? And I've been terrible with this kind of communication because I've been oblivious. So thanks for letting me share that, everybody. That was actually an important learning for me to tease out that I had not thought of before.",

Microsoft famously said, we're not doing it anymore. And I'm going like, no, you're still doing it. doesn't matter. So you're basically presenting the language that your manager will bring to the other managers about your massively performative task. You've been doing and the achievements thing is that I've never been. I've stack ranks very well, so unfortunately, I don't want to point out any kind of mistakes I've ever had, even though my manager probably is happy to bring them up during stack ranks and up to my skip level on up and things like that. So it's been a different experience for me, but I can kind of see how it would be good for you. But, you know, once again, they'll always tell you, don't spend more than two hours on it, and that's all BS because you're going to spend weeks of worrying about it. But anyways, yeah, so I've never been in that position where I really have to, you know, really have to champion myself, except maybe on the resume, but I can kind of see how that would then, your time invested would be carefully, you know, would be valid to put into words, you know, on your resume, things like that, so that your manager can better express what you've done.",

      "verbatim_text": "Okay, let's hop into phase two of this. Not behind schedule, but I want to keep right on the schedule. What I had in mind for today. One two people to make presentations about what they're working on, what their goal is, if they're trying to upgrade to a different job, or if they're trying to create, you know, a business of their own of some sort. Two presentations, kind of impromptu. Yeah, so, but before we do that, I want to speak maybe for 10 or 15 minutes about basically being good peer coaches for each other. Um, because I think that's a big concept here of a mastermind group is, we don't want to just be, you know, giving the, the advice of, if I were in your shoes, I would do such and such. We all know that doesn't work, because we're not in someone else's shoes, and we never will be. We might begin to empathize in some way, but we're never really going to know what there's going on for them. So, just want to be careful about that sort of thing. I, I like the idea that, uh, that Hallowell's where I first idea that it's a The Ferrari brain and the bicycle brakes. I think it's interesting. mean, like any metaphor, it has its limitations. But we are very creative and sometimes what, as a general, as a species, right, ADHD people are pretty creative. And so their ideas may not come out in a way that you think is going to work because they haven't had a chance to process it and get it all out there. it takes a while for that communication to happen. So we want to be careful not to, you know, decide something won't work. Just because, just that's all we knew, it wouldn't work. I want to, we want to be clear that, you know, being a peer coach is what I'm going to call this. It's not, you're not being a mechanic, right? You're not trying to fix a broken engine. And you're not a traffic cop, you know, punishing someone for whatever, running the stop sign or something. But I do think we can help people kind of recalculate where they're at and what they're doing and maybe, Provide some ideas that they can either take or leave, and they can massage those ideas later and figure it out. So I think one of the things I had in my notes here is to just presume competence, right? It's not your field. It might not even be their field yet, but they will figure it out. And so just presume that they know what they're talking about. And if you're not sure what they're talking about, ask more questions, right? Don't decide it won't work. It's amazing how many big ideas people have been told for years that their idea wouldn't work. So I think there's a certain skill to it. So we'll emphasize curiosity over interrogation. And I see you nodding, Star. There are people in the room that know more how to do this than I do. So I'll count on you guys to help guide us along. So I think, you know, we do struggle with some of these things, and we just want to be careful with them. Um, I've got a little bit more here, but questions on that, or thoughts on that process? That beginning, you know, don't be the traffic cop kind of thing?",

I think what, this is all, this is why we call it a pilot group, right, we're figuring out how to do this. I think there's going to be like a mini coaching lesson on how to be a coach, actually, which is kind of funny, because two of my clients actually plan on being coaches, that's why they engaged me to figure out how to do it, which I think is a little odd, because I'm not even sure how to do it myself, but the idea is we need to become good peer coaches for each other, and there are certain landmines that we want to avoid stepping on, and you might even be aware of them until you're there, right? So we want to kind of make those kind of visible. скажут hingek� much. Bye. And then there's certain ways to say things like, you know, in my notes here, says, not such a good question as, did you try setting an alarm? You know, that's kind of dismissive. That implies that they didn't try or they're stupid or something, right? So it might be better to say, you know, what kind of environment do you need to get into flow? You know, what hurdle is stopping you? What's getting in your way? Things that will help them process. I like to avoid anything that can be answered with a yes or a no. So just, I like to have something where I can ask a fairly short question and then just like winding up, let them talk, let them process whatever it is that they need. That's not hard and fast. mean, some questions are yes or no, but basically, mostly I like deeper questions than that. So one concept here is everybody in this room is a relatively high functioning adult with ADHD, right? There are people that They're struggling with whole lot harder than what we're dealing with, at least on the ADHD level, on this other background things we may have in our lives, but we've also heard over the course of our lifetimes about being lazy and irresponsible and forgetful and, you know, all these character-assassinating kind of things, so keep in mind that people can be a little triggery because we've been there, we don't like being taken back to our, you know, sixth-grade self in some sense, so, so, and I think another piece here, I'm going to wrap this up in just a minute so we stay on time, kind of separating the person from the system, kind of reframe it, you know, you don't really say, I failed because I'm disorganized. I mean, someone might say that in a way, but we want to move that to the system you're using is failing, right, and it's not working for you, so how might we be able to rethink that system or redesign it in some way? And even Even if it's a really painful thing, usually it's not throw the whole thing out, you know, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, right? Usually there's some fixes to what it is. So, you know, we don't want to ask people like the you questions that, you know, you need to be more self-disciplined or, you know, things like that. I think we're all aware of that. So I have more here, but I think that's good enough for now. Any, like, one minute's worth of questions on that? Somebody have a comment? ADHD grip is quiet. ADHD Well, I've seen that all the time. All right. So I did have in mind listening to two and maybe three. Doug, how long do you think a presentation should be? Let's divide it into two pieces. The presentation for what the person wants to do and the period of time when we have a discussion about it. And then it keeps... In their mind, there's, you know, 11 people in room besides us.",

And it's okay just to say that I want to say it out loud just so I can make it real for me. So you as an audience, to be witness, it's perfectly fine. You don't have to say, oh, I need this and this from you. But if you have, I need, I'm still sorting it out. I have specific things that I want some feedback. try to identify that. So if we say, maybe for one person, half the time for sharing and half the time for us to ask questions. Questions that they want some inquiry around or suggest patterns that we see instead of, oh, I know. We the answer here because we probably don't, but it's practices that thing. So maybe half and half. So if we have two blocks and we only want 30 minutes, then, you know, 15 each and then seven half each. Or if we want to extend it out, looking at the time, we got an hour or so. Spitball in here. Let's say 20 minutes per person and, you know, half explaining, half for us reacting and being in inquiry with that with her. And that gets us 40 minutes and then time to wrap up. How's that sound?",

The first thing I think that I would suggest is to, maybe before you start figuring out what you're going to do, to like, actually work with your nervous system first. your paperwork And because the reason I say that is because I'm like you, I get very overwhelmed when there are lots of steps, there's lots of ideas, there's lots of projects, there's lots of steps, and I'm like, oh my God, I don't even know where to begin, and then shut down. Can't do anything, right? Overwhelmed. Working with your nervous system first, before you start thinking about how you're going to, and planning how you're going to be getting your artwork out there and all of that kind of stuff that may help. And also for me, breaking things down, like maybe prioritizing a few projects versus all of the projects, like maybe the ones that will like bring you, you think will bring you the most money or who's been in the most interest with people or, and then breaking it down into steps and maybe just focusing on, you know, like only a few steps at a time.

      "verbatim_text": "Okay. So, oh wait. Is this the first slide? Okay, so the invisible cost of fitting in, the truth about masking, and it's by me. I'm Emmy nominated for outstanding performance in any social situation. Ask anybody. So, next slide. So, in Dr. Amen's video, he was basically talking about what is the best case use for SSRIs. And he went on to say that serotonin helps you if you're worried, if you're rigid, if you're inflexible. It's if things don't go your way, you get upset, and so I don't know why, but I really just started to think about that word worry, and I was like, worry, I mean, like, I worry all the time, right, I worry about whether or not I'll be misunderstood, right, and to me, there's no point in worrying about it, because it kind of is going to happen a lot anyway, and sometimes I even think that worrying is a great thing, like worrying makes me, like when I was working as a nurse in the hospital, worrying made me worry about quality, right, when I was interacting with people, I worry about integrity, I worry about expressing myself clearly and thoroughly, I worry just about everything, right, and so I don't know that worry in and of itself is pathological, because I think it starts off as conscientiousness, and then eventually it crosses over into this line where it becomes pathological worry, so then I begin to wonder, like, like, where exactly Exactly is that line. And so healthy worry, that's conscientiousness, right? I think it points to a value, right? Quality, integrity, clarity. It produces a tangible next step, and then it lets go because you've done what's controllable versus pathological worry doesn't reliably produce an action or action doesn't reduce it. It keeps running after the reasonable steps are taken, and it feels compulsory, like you're trying to buy certainty with thoughts. And we kind of know, like, it doesn't work that way. And so the parallel that I was able to draw from this emotion, which is worry to masking is, and was I masking because I was worried about being misunderstood? Okay. So then now that brings me to this question that we all have circling in our heads. I don't know how often, but do we, to mask or to unmask? So I think interestingly enough, people, you know, people assume, it's, it's, one or the other, right? So masking maybe feels safer in the moment, but it does actually require you to bundle all of your inner thoughts and emotions, right, into a jar, and then you toss it into the closet with, you toss it into the closet, it gets tossed along with all of the skeletons in your closet, right, which is namely all your other ADHD quirks, and so even during the interaction, you feel as though you're carrying this illegal contraband, right, like that's the weight of the guilt you feel. So that's option number one. So Option number two, you don't mask, and you risk being rejected or misunderstood. So on the surface, it looks like a zero-sum game, but I actually think that there's a third option that maybe people haven't considered, which is, let's say you unmask, and you risk being rejected or misunderstood. I think, and I was telling Rick this yesterday, I think there's always this option for clarity and repair because you can't can't really control the misunderstanding, but you can still try to influence the outcome even after the misunderstanding has occurred. And so, any MBAs in the room by chance? Show of hands. Zero-sum game. We just basically assume like it's all or nothing, but I just don't know that that's true, right? I win or you lose. So, now I had to put this into a systems perspective. So, if you think of a thermostat, right, the goal is to keep the room temp at 70 degrees, but reality is sometimes the temperature fluctuates, right? And so, the system's response to that is that heat turns on to correct the error, right? It doesn't try to eliminate cold forever. It just detects the drift and then it corrects it repeatedly. And so, I think the problem with masking and why it produces this excess worry and anxiety is because we're so consumed with trying to get it perfect on the... First Pass or to have a smooth first pass, but really, I think what I learned throughout life is how do you recover from imperfect passes? And I think that actually eventually turns into your competitive advantage. And so that's why I called it a zero-sum game. You don't really need perfect understanding up front. You just need capacity to repair misunderstanding when it happens because it will. Okay, so I drew a little system for you guys. Sorry, I got a little carried away, right? So we have a goal, which is what you want. We have the So to do. the And then we're measuring the gap and we're adjusting our behavior accordingly. At least I think that's what's happening, right? Because even if you observe like even neurotypicals, right? If we study reality and we watch neurotypicals interact and communicate, like their social interactions aren't perfect. Like people misunderstand each other all the time, right? They miss nuance. Sometimes people's tone gets misread. Sometimes a So we option you Context is complete. Sometimes someone is stressed or distracted, so if your strategy is, I must not be misunderstood, you're basically asking for an impossible, perfect control system, and so, so why does this matter? Masking is basically trying to eliminate error in advance. You're pre-editing everything, you're hiding anything that you think is risky, and you're aiming for zero misunderstanding. So, while it can reduce error short term, it's expensive, it's and it often fails. And I think our life experiences have taught us that as well. So, my reframe for this post is, unmasking is not be raw and hope for the best, it's just be real and be skillful. And I also thought, while I was in this rabbit hole, well, I'd like, I'd actually like to play the devil's advocate, right? Oh, wait. Because, hey, Jasmine, isn't there a line that's There's between skill building and self-erasure, and there is, right? I think there's a line. Skill building is expanding your behavioral repertoire with choice, whereas masking is narrowing that repertoire under pressure. And so I don't think the goal is to be normal, and I don't think the goal is do whatever you want, but coordination. And so when I'm talking to people, because sometimes I can make the mistake of being too direct, I kind of like to step into this mindset of how can we work together in order to get the best result? Because my goal is clarity and mutual understanding.",
