Hey everyone,

Thanks for showing up today! Here's your recap.

**Tuesday, January 6, 2026** | 102 minutes | [Recording](https://fathom.video/share/sMBXxxThqtUtyesQo3WmjACj7FR6cWjG)

### Who Was Here
Doug Snyder, Rick Webster, Jasmine Mahmoud, Lizzy Summers, Stara Shakti, Gio, Raghu Kalyan, Rich Malsch, Rishi Badlani, Destiny Owens, Melissa Reskof (11 people)

### What Happened
Halfway through the pilot, the group focused on peer coaching principles and held three member presentations. Rick introduced guidelines for being supportive peer coaches, then Lizzy, Stara, and Jasmine each presented their current projects and received group feedback. Jasmine's presentation on masking and worry sparked significant interest.

### Topics Covered
- Peer coaching principles - presume competence, ask questions not advice
- Performance reviews and self-advocacy (Doug's celebration)
- Lizzy's art business: window coverings vs. accessories vs. prints
- Stara's Decolonizing Therapy program enrollment
- Jasmine's masking framework - worry, conscientiousness, and repair
- Organization challenges - planners, object permanence, habit stacking

### Member Check-ins

**Doug Snyder**: Completed annual performance appraisal - two weeks late but done. Treated it differently this time, doing it for himself instead of performatively.
- *Challenge:* Procrastination was a signal - wasn't in a safe space to look at it calmly
- *Insight:* Boss has been championing him; needed to honor that messaging instead of focusing on where he could have done better

**Gio**: Found what lights her up - stayed up all night making music in GarageBand. Wrote a song for her daughters, working on a song about depression.
- *Challenge:* Not sure how to apply music creation practically
- *Insight:* Really into putting puzzle pieces together to make what she thinks is a good song

**Rishi Badlani**: Working on updating resume, looking for a new job but wanting something purposeful rather than parallel job.
- *Challenge:* Hasn't been consistent in attending

### Standout Moments

**Peer Coaching Principles**
*Rick Webster* (00:09:27 - 00:22:00)

Rick laid out principles for being effective peer coaches to each other, emphasizing that we're not mechanics fixing engines or traffic cops punishing mistakes.

> "We don't want to just be giving the advice of, if I were in your shoes, I would do such and such. We all know that doesn't work."

> "You don't know what's behind someone's smile. People are struggling with things that we might not know about."

**Lizzy's Art Business Crossroads**
*Lizzy Summers* (00:25:16 - 00:40:37)

Lizzy presented her dilemma: she has multiple product lines (large art panels, prints, Comfort Nest travel accessories) and is struggling with which to focus on. Groundhog day feeling of always having more steps to complete.

> "Every product I have, every step I get, there's a thousand other steps I need to do."

> "I'm at this impasse. This happens over and over and over. It's my groundhog nightmare."

> "Something that can make money fast, least output, least amount of nervous system stress."

**Jasmine's Masking Framework**
*Jasmine Mahmoud* (00:58:54 - 01:10:00)

Jasmine presented her framework on masking, inspired by Dr. Amen's work on SSRIs and worry. She reframed masking as trying to eliminate error in advance, and proposed unmasking as 'be real and skillful' with capacity for repair.

> "Masking is basically trying to eliminate error in advance. You're pre-editing everything, hiding anything risky, aiming for zero misunderstanding."

> "How can I be a voice that can help counter that negativity? On social media it's very much a culture of despair."

### Themes That Emerged
**Ask Questions, Don't Give Advice**: Rick's peer coaching principles and the group's practice throughout the presentations showed the power of questions over prescriptions.

**Nervous System Before Productivity**: Multiple members acknowledged that calming the nervous system comes before tackling tasks - Lizzy arriving activated, Stara needing grounding before action.

**The Overwhelm of Too Many Options**: Both Lizzy and Stara struggle with too many products/projects and not knowing which to focus on. Simplification and prioritization emerged as needs.

### Commitments Made
- **Stara Shakti**: Start using paper planner - keep it open on desk at all times
- **Stara Shakti**: Put RenaFi co-working sessions in calendar
- **Jasmine Mahmoud**: Continue developing masking framework content for social media

Right. And before it was a performative, somehow I'll say something magic that will make up for that screw up that I'm ..."

> [00:04:33] "Yeah, I just want to celebrate that the hard thing that I had to do, which was my annual performance appraisal. I did get it done. It was two weeks late, but my boss was gone for those two weeks. So, yay, it's done. This time I... It was hard in a different way where I was trying to do it for myself..."

> [00:22:05] "Okay, so I think it's a great question. And really, what would our goals be out of this? part of it would be, oh, I'd like to share this thing, and this is what I need from you guys. Or this is what I would like to get out of it. And it's okay just to say that I want to say it out loud just so I can..."

> [00:10:50] "Okay, let's hop into phase two of this. Not behind schedule, but I want to keep right on the schedule. What I had in mind for today.

> [01:15:38] "I found for myself sometimes, I have no idea why I'm attracted to learning certain things, and sometimes, you know, maybe nothing ever comes out of it. But other times, later on in life, I say, oh my gosh, I'm so glad I learned that, or at least I had some inkling that that kind of thing happened or..."

Microsoft famously said, we're not doing it anymore. And I'm going like, no, you're still doing it. doesn't m..."
