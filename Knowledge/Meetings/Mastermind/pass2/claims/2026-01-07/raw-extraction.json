Each person was supposed to select a group, Tuesday or Wednesday. But since we ended up with a smaller group, and some people couldn't come on Tuesday, but they could on Wednesday and vice versa.

And so it draws a specific type of person, like, and specific people have expressed interests and came to this small little group in December that we did, the trial kind of run.

Yeah, Greg, just trying to figure out how to stack things together where you're intrinsically motivated, do it, and the exercise by itself stinks, and of course we have these opinions about what we should do. So my formulas, it took a while to get there, but to go every morning at 6 a.m., and I go hike up a local hill that's right outside my house, so I'm lucky that way. But I do some movement and talk with people and wake up and talk about interesting ideas, so I get four things in once. But those things allow the exercise to become a habit. The exercise never, it stunk. Who wants to get up in the morning? Well, I got up because I was going to support my buddy. And then connection, and then feeling good. good. .",
