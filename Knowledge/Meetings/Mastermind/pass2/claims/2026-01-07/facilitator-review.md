> [00:08:40] "And what happened, and this is unique to the pilot, it won't be the case later when we kind of build this out, but I invited, like, I don't know, 18 or 20 people, thinking we would get at least 14, 18, and then we would have two days. Each person was supposed to select a group, Tuesday or Wednesday...."

> [00:01:34] "That's interesting, too, because mastermind primarily is people interfacing. Here's something I'm wrestling with. You know, I've got seven, eight, 10 other kind of peer coaches in a way. And that's actually going to be an ancillary benefit here is what we're going to be doing is teaching everybody h..."

> [00:15:19] "Yeah, let's do, yeah, and it's not going to be hard, let's do the first two presentations, and then if we have time, we'll get to you, Greg, if you want to, after you've heard about how the model works.

> [01:05:50] "I think it's important to remember, and I mean, speaking from experience, right, like, you just, you won't be able to make everybody happy. It's just gonna, gotta do what you want to do, and... And run it how you want to run it, do the things you like, and, you know, some people will come, they'll g..."

> [00:44:27] "Well, I mean, I think I, you know, I, you've mentioned as well as to me, but I think that the social matrix is awfully important.

I was doing my totes, now I'm doing my accent pan..."

> [00:59:11] "Okay, first of all, just amazing. I love it. I think your avenue is brilliant. Because myself, I started, I had a lot of speech impeccablements, and singing has always been torturous for me. But actually, there's a lot of somatic exercises which are about sound, about homing. There's so much you can..."

> [00:41:03] "Oh, yeah. So, the bar thing, my parents are on the bar too at one point in time, but what I'm getting, what's underneath that, is I think you do like to be around people.

> [01:40:13] "And then the second thing is just to begin like a resume to, you know, just to eat and exercise. I mean, mostly exercise, but, you know, yeah, that's where I'm at. I'm going to throw something out here just so it was heard once. I'm not asking anyone to be doing anything. But Doug got a diabetes dia..."
