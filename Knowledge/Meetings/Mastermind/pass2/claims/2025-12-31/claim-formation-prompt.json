One of the things I've discovered about myself, though, I used to put half-hour alarms for when I had to leave to go, because I was driving places, right, so it's time, when we went to everything online, I changed that to 10 minutes, because if you give me a half-hour, I can easily get involved in something and forget, so, and now I've actually changed my, most of my alarms to five minutes before an appointment, because it's still enough time for me to get a glass of water, but I still get there on time, but it's not enough time for me to get too deep in into something else, and I actually still try to sweep something into the five minutes.

So am I under stress, right? Is something bad going to happen? And I found out, no, it wasn't. And that release of, no, I'm not in trouble, made it so that a little bit of urgency, oh, and, you know, make a reminder, an alarm, any number of things I might have done wasn't available to me at that point. I didn't have that mental model, I was just like, oh. I imagine the bad thing that would happen didn't happen made it so this other thing was really unavailable in some way to do something with afterwards in any way, shape, or form.

So do you have like, can you, I don't know. Like, some instruction on doing that. Like, I mean, like literal instruction, like, okay, this is how I do my day. And okay, Gio, what do you need to do? Like, I kind of need something like that. I'm wondering if there was, you know, somebody who can, I don't know, maybe that's a body doubling thing. Because my, my assignment, Doug, I, what did I do? I got up. And I was was I yeah, guess it was today, I was thinking, oh, I should at least clean up one room before the new year, and then I was like, oh, I'm going to listen to some music while I clean up, and then I was like, actually, wait a minute, I could do some more vocalizing while I clean up, and it's like, if I had put that in my, you know, vocalizing or whatever, even if I didn't do it, it would be there in my face, and I don't know, like, there just seems so much, I guess I'm dealing with a lot of overwhelm, I don't even know where to start, and, but, of course, doing something that I typically enjoy doing it, because sometimes vocalizing seems like homework, and I guess when I get, you know, but I think that's kind of like the perfectionist thing, too. It's like before I start working on a song, I have to vocalize, I have to do this, and then I don't feel like doing anything with anything with singing, you know, or, yeah, get down the rabbit hole of trying to find, like, the perfect video or, you know, Spotify, spending time on that, whereas, you know, I could schedule that in, but I don't think about it then.

I'm going to have to, I'm going to try to hold it up against my values so that I can say that needs to come off the list.

I need to, you know, but I also need long blocks of deep work to do this thing, you know? Okay. And a first principle would be breaking it down. And what's not clear there is that I'm looking for first principles that if I do them, I'll pick up other first principles and maybe secondary and third ones that, you know, affect so that I'm trying to get something that. Captures the essence and do that. Look for that thing. So as an example of a carmaker that makes electric cars, who the founder has been in the news quite a bit in the last year and a half for a lot of crazy reasons, right? One of the things he did when he was analyzing whether or not to start Tesla cars or to go into that business was not, I'm gonna get stuck on how expensive batteries were for these cars, right? Because they really weren't out there. In fact, if you look at what those car batteries are, they actually look like AA batteries. Yep. It's just a giant, giant number of them, right, in one pack. But what he did was, as a decision matrix, he went and said, hey, how expensive are the raw materials? And how expensive is it to make? And wow, I'm paying a giant amount of markup for this. So it makes it very difficult to have this car business to rely on an external supplier for these batteries. It's worth it to build our own capacity because it is a foundational first principle about the product we're offering, which is an electric car, so I better have a great supply of batteries, and I need to control costs, and his question was, how expensive are the raw materials and how much you make it? turns out, oh, this is way, way important to engage in, so different ways of looking what's the problem, like when you were talking about your enrollment thing, and Melissa say, hey, it sounds kind of like an enrollment party, I know somebody did something like that, and you go, it is kind of, because what? It's a party, I want people to want to be here, there's something good about it, there's a first principle about how do you market, know, it's not, do you blast everybody, do you send an email, do you spend a lot of time crafting the perfect message? No, a first principle would be, let me connect with my people early and often, and listen to what they say, and reflect it back and see if anybody else wants it too, because they told you, Yeah, I like this. And you go, that's what I was hoping to give you. Great. Hey, anybody else who wants that? So a first principle about marketing is not figuring out a marketing campaign, but do it with your people and then see what they say and go, hey, this is what we're doing over here. Anybody else want to do this? A very different way of marketing. So a first principle instead of, oh, am I supposed to do all the things that marketing means? And you may not be a lot of expertise in that. And it's really, hey, you that are appropriate for this, come on over. And if it's not for you, not a problem. But this is probably not for you. That's great. So that's how to think about some of these first principles. So in this use case here is we make assumptions about stuff. What are they really? And then we can go, what can I change here?",

Follow these rules STRICTLY:\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n\n1. **Quote-First**: Every claim must reference specific utterance IDs\n2. **No Fabrication**: Never add words, phrases, or concepts not in the source\n3. **No Conflation**: Don't merge ideas from different speakers without explicit attribution\n4. **No Embellishment**: Don't add emotional interpretation (e.g., \"felt frustrated\", \"was excited\")\n5. **Honest Confidence**: Mark claims honestly:\n   - 'verbatim': The claim uses the speaker's exact words\n   - 'paraphrase': The claim restates what was said in different words\n   - 'inference': The claim draws a conclusion from what was said (REQUIRES rationale)\n\n## WHAT TO EXTRACT\n\nFor each speaker with substantial content, create claims for:\n- speaker_said: Direct quotes (confidence: verbatim)\n- speaker_expressed: Paraphrased ideas (confidence: paraphrase)\n- speaker_committed: Any commitments made (confidence: verbatim preferred)\n- speaker_reacted: Responses to others (confidence: verbatim or paraphrase)\n- attribution_given: When someone credits another (confidence: verbatim)\n\n## FORBIDDEN\n\n- Using words not in the source (e.g., \"pivot\" when they said \"change\")\n- Adding emotional descriptors (e.g., \"enthusiastically shared\")\n- Synthesizing concepts the speaker didn't connect themselves\n- Attributing insights to someone who didn't explicitly state them\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nReturn a JSON array of claims following the Claim interface schema.\nEach claim must have:\n- id: Unique identifier (e.g., \"claim-001\")\n- type: One of the ClaimType values\n- content: { subject, assertion, quoted_text (if applicable) }\n- evidence: Array of { utterance_id, relationship, source_lines }\n- confidence: 'verbatim' | 'paraphrase' | 'inference'\n- inference_rationale: Required if confidence is 'inference'\n"
