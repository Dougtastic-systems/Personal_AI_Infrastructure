Hey everyone,

Thanks for showing up today! Here's your recap.

**Wednesday, December 31, 2025** | 104 minutes | [Recording](https://fathom.video/share/b5B5GuEup8qGjQ9muBRDSzwdKhgycf5Y)

### Who Was Here
Doug Snyder, Rick Webster, Lizzy Summers, Stara Shakti, Gio (5 people)

### What Happened
New Year's Eve session focused on procrastination as a signal (not a failure), values-based planning, and the power of external support structures. Lizzy's 'last mile' problem and Stara's follow-up block sparked rich discussion about root causes and practical solutions.

### Topics Covered
- Procrastination as a signal of misalignment with values
- VIA Character Strengths and Values/Personality/Skills Venn diagram
- Rick's daily planning system - plan tonight, execute tomorrow
- Doug's first principles framework - values as personal first principles
- Lizzy's 'Crappy Childhood Fairy' brain-sweep practice
- Human Design for understanding energy patterns
- Body doubling schedules and 'professional package' concept

### Member Check-ins

**Lizzy Summers**: Completes 90% of tasks but struggles with the final 10% - a phone call avoided since July, a $50/mo camp electricity bill left running.
- *Challenge:* Fear of the unknown after success, discomfort with being seen or praised
- *Insight:* Human Design chart shows 'starter' energy but lacks 'completion' gate - need collaboration to fill energy gaps
- *Commitment:* Finalize a product and create full marketing campaign

**Stara Shakti**: Difficulty completing post-meeting tasks, like sending bio/headshot to Melissa for Jan 11 podcast.
- *Challenge:* High motivation from good meetings fades when facing solo administrative work
- *Commitment:* Send bio/headshot to Melissa, meet with Gio to sing and discuss collaboration

**Gio**: Feeling directionless without the structure of flying, struggling with where to start each day.
- *Challenge:* Lack of structure leads to negative self-talk and binge-watching
- *Insight:* Sang with herself and remembered she enjoys it - 'I actually like doing this'
- *Commitment:* Review 'The Life You Were Born to Lead' to find a personal system

### Standout Moments

**Rick's Daily Planning System**
*Rick Webster* (00:40:00 - 00:55:00)

Rick shared his system for overcoming the emotional paralysis of daily decisions by separating planning from execution.

> "When you wake up, you're not making decisions - you're just following the plan you made last night."

**Doug's First Principles Framework**
*Doug Snyder* (01:00:00 - 01:10:00)

Doug introduced first principles thinking as a way to connect daily actions to fundamental truths about what matters.

> "Values are your first principles. When you're aligned, you don't need willpower."

**Lizzy's Brain-Sweep Practice**
*Lizzy Summers* (01:01:00 - 01:07:00)

Lizzy shared the 'Crappy Childhood Fairy' journaling practice for clearing mental debris.

> "I came to the realization that half of the stuff that's going on in my head isn't mine."

### Themes That Emerged
**Procrastination as Signal**: Procrastination and overwhelm aren't failures - they're signals of misalignment with core values, indicating a need to pause and reassess.

**Values as Compass**: Use values clarity (VIA assessment, first principles) to make choices that feel empowering rather than draining.

**External Structure for Internal Chaos**: Body doubling, pre-made packages, and evening planning provide external scaffolding when internal motivation wavers.

### Commitments Made
- **Lizzy Summers**: Finalize a product and create full marketing campaign (blog, email, social media)
- **Stara Shakti**: Send bio/headshot to Melissa for Jan 11 podcast *(before Jan 11)*
- **Stara Shakti**: Meet with Gio to sing and discuss potential collaboration
- **Gio**: Review 'The Life You Were Born to Lead' to find a personal system
- **Doug Snyder**: Create private Mighty Networks section for shared resources

### Your Contributions

You spoke 85 times during the session.

**Key moments from you:**

> [01:11:22] "Yeah. In the last hour. And these assumptions that we might have, like, oh, I can't, they're non-negotiable meetings. I have to do an instant reply. I need to, you know, but I also need long blocks of deep work to do this thing, you know? Okay. And a first principle would be breaking it down. And wh..."

> [00:29:07] "As I'm listening to my own inner dialogue about this particular incident, it seemed to kind of piggyback on really your trajectory right now, Stara, and really kind of the core underneath of that inspiring thing that Jasmine shared, which was I was out of, I was in fear of relief, right? So am I und..."

> [00:25:54] "No, I scheduled it for this week because nobody wants to have, there's no lawyers that want I'm anything now, Rhea, none, and so this is the perfect week to get it, and I forgot to do it Sunday morning, and I remembered midday, and I'm like, I'm not near something I was freaking out about, like, oh ..."

### Your Contributions

You spoke 109 times during the session.

**Key moments from you:**

> [00:44:35] "I do have a process, and my process won't necessarily work for everybody else, but I can tell you what it is. I plan the next day tonight. Tonight I'll be planning the next day, right? So I'll be doing that because I want to plan intellectually, not emotionally. And if I'm planning the same day, I r..."

> [00:46:51] "So here's a core thing for me. I don't know if I've ever actually realized or said this before, but my list is not that. That's... That's the list that I got from Anthropic, but my list is like that, it's just shorter things that are combined, but I'm going to hold up everything that's going on in m..."

> [01:03:14] "Open loops, trash, yeah, all that. And I don't have a study to cite, but it seems to me that people with ADHD, want to fit in, and we have a really hard time fitting in when we're younger, when we're children. And so we become really good at being a chameleon, kind of wearing the mask to fit in. We ..."

**Key moments from you:**

> [00:58:18] "Two things for both of y'all that have helped me get more clear in my brain. I guarantee you that crappy childhood fairy, she has a practice every morning. You write down all your resentments. Yes. Behind every resentment, anger, hate is a fear. Then you write down, I hate Steven for not cleaning up..."

> [01:30:10] "There you go. I was going to say, too, I don't know if you've gone down the human design rabbit hole, but it's based on the I Ching and the Koran and astrology, but you have these gates, sometimes you only have half the gate, which I have, you know, I don't have the completion. There's actually a ga..."

> [01:25:53] "The other thing I want to piggyback on is we tend to be addictive. It's not necessarily drugs or alcohol. Paul, like when I learned yesterday, I overcommitted because I'm so addicted to that feeling of failure and feeling of disappointment, so I have to ask myself, that was so helpful to see that ha..."

### Your Contributions

You spoke 107 times during the session.

**Key moments from you:**

> [00:12:21] "was it? That was great. And I need to, I think the biggest challenge for me has been the follow-up, the follow-through, the doing what I, you know, I've said I'm going to do. You know, yes, I said yesterday to Melissa, I'll send you my picture and short bio, and I didn't do it. And I guess I'm feeli..."

> [00:14:52] "No, it's brilliant what you just said about the package. I need to, and I'm going to write that down, because package. . Like a press package or something like that, because I actually do have another person who asked me to speak on trauma or to present on trauma at a festival, an online three-day f..."

> [01:17:40] "So, in essence, maybe, I mean, maybe, like, if you're, if we're feeling overwhelmed and we're procrastinating, for example, I'll just talk about myself. If I'm feeling overwhelmed and I'm procrastinating and things, maybe, maybe going back. to my values, slash first principles, slash what's really i..."

You spoke 30 times during the session.

**Key moments from you:**

> [00:40:56] "Yeah, I wanted. I would love to have like that actual paper, but that causes a whole other set of problems for me. And yeah, I have to figure that situation out. But Rick, I was thinking about, was it yesterday? Or today? Just recently about what you said about putting stuff in your calendar, like a..."

> [00:21:35] "I totally spaced on that message. Sometimes I'm like, don't even, I never have my ringer on, volumes off. So unless I happen and I don't, I'm not the one who tries to carry the phone around everywhere I go or, you know, have it beside me. So I'll forget. And even after I, you know, how that goes aft..."

> [01:40:44] "Yay! I'm going to send the stuff to Melissa that I need to for her to promote. Meet my speaking on her podcast on January 11th. And continue. Continue to follow up with the decolonizing therapy folks, and hopefully tomorrow we'll be meeting up with Gio at some time to sing and chat and see how maybe..."
