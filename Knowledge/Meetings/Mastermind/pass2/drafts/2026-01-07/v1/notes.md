## Session Info

- Transcript: ../../../raw/2026-01-07/transcript.md

## What we extracted

### Gio's Vocal Wellness Meetup Vision (00:46:37 - 01:10:00)
- Her year-old idea for singing + mental health meetup
- 6 reactions captured (Melissa, Doug, Lizzy, Gregory, Rishi, Stara)
- 2 ripple effects (Stara shared her own parallel, Melissa connected to her experience)
- Evolution: From stuck → clarity to start informal with friends

## What worked
- High engagement (6 people) clearly captured
- Multiple challenge types: questioning, encouraging, connecting
- Stara's parallel experience (Goddess Chant Circle) is a genuine ripple

## What didn't work / Questions
- **Is this the only seminal moment from a 107-minute session?**
- Rishi also presented in this session - worth extracting?
- The body doubling discussion at the start - is that notable?
- Should we capture Gio's earlier sessions too? (Dec 30 she barely spoke, Dec 31 she talked about being directionless)

## Gio's Arc Across Sessions (longitudinal observation)
- Dec 30: Just joined, apologized for stepping in
- Dec 31: Talked about being directionless, not having structure after leaving flying
- Jan 6: Working on music in GarageBand, "stayed up all night, I really like this"
- Jan 7: Presented full vision for singing wellness meetup

**This is a trajectory story** - from lost to finding her thing.

## Next iteration ideas
- Consider adding Rishi's moment from this session
- Link to Gio's contributions in earlier sessions for longitudinal view
