## Who Was Here
Doug Snyder, Rick Webster, Lizzy Summers, Stara Shakti, Gio (5 people)

## What Happened
New Year's Eve session focused on procrastination as a signal (not a failure), values-based planning, and the power of external support structures. Lizzy's 'last mile' problem and Stara's follow-up block sparked rich discussion about root causes and practical solutions.

## Topics Covered
- Procrastination as a signal of misalignment with values
- VIA Character Strengths and Values/Personality/Skills Venn diagram
- Rick's daily planning system - plan tonight, execute tomorrow
- Doug's first principles framework - values as personal first principles
- Lizzy's 'Crappy Childhood Fairy' brain-sweep practice
- Human Design for understanding energy patterns
- Body doubling schedules and 'professional package' concept

## Member Check-ins

**Lizzy Summers**: Completes 90% of tasks but struggles with the final 10% - a phone call avoided since July, a $50/mo camp electricity bill left running.
- *Challenge:* Fear of the unknown after success, discomfort with being seen or praised
- *Insight:* Human Design chart shows 'starter' energy but lacks 'completion' gate - need collaboration to fill energy gaps
- *Commitment:* Finalize a product and create full marketing campaign

**Stara Shakti**: Difficulty completing post-meeting tasks, like sending bio/headshot to Melissa for Jan 11 podcast.
- *Challenge:* High motivation from good meetings fades when facing solo administrative work
- *Commitment:* Send bio/headshot to Melissa, meet with Gio to sing and discuss collaboration

**Gio**: Feeling directionless without the structure of flying, struggling with where to start each day.
- *Challenge:* Lack of structure leads to negative self-talk and binge-watching
- *Insight:* Sang with herself and remembered she enjoys it - 'I actually like doing this'
- *Commitment:* Review 'The Life You Were Born to Lead' to find a personal system

## Standout Moments

### Rick's Daily Planning System
*Rick Webster* (00:40:00 - 00:55:00)

Rick shared his system for overcoming the emotional paralysis of daily decisions by separating planning from execution.

**The Framework:**
- Plan the next day TONIGHT - make decisions intellectually, not emotionally
- Calendar EVERYTHING - including non-work items like exercise
- Align with values - hold all activities against core values to avoid resentment
- Separate thinking modes: outcome-based (the 'summit') for planning, action-based (the 'next step') for doing

**Key Insights:**
> "When you wake up, you're not making decisions - you're just following the plan you made last night."

**How It Landed:**
- **Gio**: Asked for literal instruction on how to do this - 'I kind of need something like that'
- **Lizzy Summers**: Connected it to her need for structure despite non-traditional career path

**Ripple Effect:** Sparked discussion about body doubling as external support for execution

### Doug's First Principles Framework
*Doug Snyder* (01:00:00 - 01:10:00)

Doug introduced first principles thinking as a way to connect daily actions to fundamental truths about what matters.

**The Framework:**
- Break a problem down to its fundamental truths, free from assumptions
- Values are personal first principles
- When actions align with values, motivation and agency increase
- Misalignment creates the feeling of procrastination

**Key Insights:**
> "Values are your first principles. When you're aligned, you don't need willpower."

**How It Landed:**
- **Lizzy Summers**: Connected to her realization that half the stuff in her head isn't hers

### Lizzy's Brain-Sweep Practice
*Lizzy Summers* (01:01:00 - 01:07:00)

Lizzy shared the 'Crappy Childhood Fairy' journaling practice for clearing mental debris.

**The Framework:**
- Write down resentments
- Identify the underlying fear
- Tear up the paper
- Purpose: 'Sweep the brain' to gain clarity on true priorities

**Key Insights:**
> "I came to the realization that half of the stuff that's going on in my head isn't mine."

**How It Landed:**
- **Gio**: Asked for more details - 'What does that process look like? Is it a book?'

**Ripple Effect:** Gio noted wanting to get back to 'safety and nervous system regulation' - connecting Lizzy's practice to Jasmine's framework from previous session

## Themes That Emerged
**Procrastination as Signal**: Procrastination and overwhelm aren't failures - they're signals of misalignment with core values, indicating a need to pause and reassess.

**Values as Compass**: Use values clarity (VIA assessment, first principles) to make choices that feel empowering rather than draining.

**External Structure for Internal Chaos**: Body doubling, pre-made packages, and evening planning provide external scaffolding when internal motivation wavers.

## Commitments Made
- **Lizzy Summers**: Finalize a product and create full marketing campaign (blog, email, social media)
- **Stara Shakti**: Send bio/headshot to Melissa for Jan 11 podcast *(before Jan 11)*
- **Stara Shakti**: Meet with Gio to sing and discuss potential collaboration
- **Gio**: Review 'The Life You Were Born to Lead' to find a personal system
- **Doug Snyder**: Create private Mighty Networks section for shared resources

## Announcements
- **Rick Webster**: Body doubling schedule: M-F 7:30-8:30 AM PT; Tue/Wed/Fri 10:00-11:30 AM PT; Mon/Thu 5:00-7:00 PM PT
