      "speaker": "Jasmine Mahmoud",
      "time_range": "00:52:00 - 01:15:00",
      "core_insight": "When we ask ourselves, 'How am I going to do this?' or 'What if it doesn't work?' Those questions put us in a bad state. What if we replace them with: 'What would make today successful?'",
      "group_response": "Julie called it 'amazing,' Stara said it could be a TED talk, and Lizzy immediately applied it to her day."
