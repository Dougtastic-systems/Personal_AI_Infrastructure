## Seminal Moments

### Framework: Interrupting Rumination Spirals
**When:** 00:52:00 - 01:15:00 | **Led by:** Jasmine Mahmoud | **Engagement:** 4 people

**Core insight:**
> "When we ask ourselves, 'How am I going to do this?' or 'What if it doesn't work?' Those questions put us in a bad state. What if we replace them with: 'What would make today successful?'"

**Group Response:**
- **Julie Dorshkind**: "This is amazing. I've never heard a framework like that before."
- **Stara Shakti**: "This could be a TED talk."
- **Doug Snyder** (challenge): "Jasmine, use your framework. I want to hear, what is the one thing, your one thing that you want to do, and we'll check in."
- **Julie Dorshkind** (connection): "The language is so key. The question 'what would make today successful' versus 'what do I need to get done' - completely different energy."

**Ripple Effects:**
- **Lizzy Summers**: Immediately applied the framework to her own day — "I'll figure out one thing I want to do today. Just one thing."
- **Julie Dorshkind**: Connected to her coaching work with clients
