# Pass 2 Draft v1 - 2025-12-30

## Session Info
- Title: DCM - MasterMind Pilot
- Duration: 94 minutes
- Transcript: ../../../raw/2025-12-30/transcript.md

## What we extracted

### Jasmine's Framework Presentation (00:52:00 - 01:15:00)
- Her rumination-interruption framework
- 4 reactions captured (Julie, Stara, Doug, Julie again)
- 2 ripple effects (Lizzy applied it, Julie connected to her work)
- Evolution tracked (started generic → iterated after Doug's challenge)
- Attribution: She credited Doug

## What worked
- Quote selection captures the essence
- Evolution tracking shows the arc within the session
- Reactions categorized (validation vs challenge vs connection)

## What didn't work / Questions
- **Is one moment enough for a 94-minute session?**
- What other moments might we be missing?
- Doug's challenge to Jasmine - is that impactful enough to be its own moment?
- The "TED talk" comment from Stara - should we track what happened with that?

## Next iteration ideas
- Review full transcript for other high-engagement segments
- Consider: Did anyone else have a seminal moment this session?
- Maybe add a "medium impact" tier for notable-but-not-seminal moments
