**Tuesday, December 30, 2025** | 94 minutes | [Recording](https://fathom.video/share/QHk27d_kexdKUwF6ECwir7m4HzRyArN1)

## Who Was Here
Doug Snyder, Rick Webster, Jasmine Mahmoud, Lizzy Summers, Stara Shakti, Julie Dorshkind, David Ludwig, Melissa Reskof, Gio (9 people)

## What Happened
Our pilot session focused on introductions, sharing what's on our minds, and discovering common threads around productivity, nervous system regulation, and accountability. Jasmine's framework on interrupting rumination spirals sparked significant discussion and immediate application from the group.

## Topics Covered
- Introductions and check-ins
- What's working and what's challenging right now
- Jasmine's rumination-interruption framework
- Nervous system vs productivity hacks
- Body doubling and accountability
- Commitments for the week

## Standout Moment

### Framework: Interrupting Rumination Spirals
*Jasmine Mahmoud* (00:52:00 - 01:15:00)

Jasmine shared a framework she developed for breaking out of unproductive mental loops. The core problem: when we're stuck, we ask ourselves questions like 'How am I going to do this?' or 'What if it doesn't work?' - questions that keep us in a bad state.

**The Framework:**
- Notice when you're in a rumination spiral (anxiety, paralysis, negative self-talk)
- Recognize the unhelpful questions you're asking yourself
- Replace them with: 'What would make today successful?'
- This isn't a productivity hack - it's a nervous system intervention

**Key Insights:**
> "We don't need generic productivity hacks. We actually need nervous system interventions."

> "On the horizon, potentially countering culture of despair... that's what gets me excited."

**How It Landed:**
- **Julie Dorshkind**: This is amazing. I've never heard a framework like that before.
- **Stara Shakti**: This could be a TED talk.
- **Doug Snyder**: Challenged Jasmine to use her own framework and report back.
- **Lizzy Summers**: Immediately applied it: 'I'll figure out one thing I want to do today. Just one thing.'

**Ripple Effect:** Julie noted the power of language: 'What would make today successful?' vs 'What do I need to get done?' creates completely different energy.

## Themes That Emerged
**Nervous System Over Productivity**: We don't need better productivity hacks - we need interventions that regulate our nervous system state first.

**The Power of Better Questions**: The specific words we use in self-inquiry change our state and outcomes. 'What would make today successful?' vs 'What do I need to get done?' creates completely different energy.

## Commitments Made
- **Jasmine Mahmoud**: Use her own framework and report back *(next session)*
- **Lizzy Summers**: Figure out one thing to do today *(today)*

## Your Personal Highlights

### What You Shared
**Framework: Interrupting Rumination Spirals**

> "When we ask ourselves, 'How am I going to do this?' or 'What if it doesn't work?' Those questions put us in a bad state. What if we replace them with: 'What would make today successful?'"

> "We don't need generic productivity hacks. We actually need nervous system interventions."

> "On the horizon, potentially countering culture of despair... that's what gets me excited. It would be a lifelong journey."

*How it landed:* Julie Dorshkind: "This is amazing. I've never heard a framework like that before."; Stara Shakti: "This could be a TED talk."; Doug Snyder: "Jasmine, use your framework. I want to hear, what is the one thing, your one thing that you want to do, and we'll check in."; Julie Dorshkind: "The language is so key. The question 'what would make today successful' versus 'what do I need to get done' - completely different energy."
*Your evolution:* Started with Presenting a generic question framework for productivity, ended with Iterated to more specific version after Doug's challenge; committed to applying it herself

### Your Commitments
- Use your own framework and report back *(next session)*
