## Your Contributions

### Your Contribution: Framework: Interrupting Rumination Spirals
**Time:** 00:52:00 - 01:15:00

**What you shared:**
> "When we ask ourselves, 'How am I going to do this?' or 'What if it doesn't work?' Those questions put us in a bad state. What if we replace them with: 'What would make today successful?'"

> "We don't need generic productivity hacks. We actually need nervous system interventions."

> "On the horizon, potentially countering culture of despair... that's what gets me excited. It would be a lifelong journey."

**How it landed:**
- **Julie Dorshkind** affirmed: "This is amazing. I've never heard a framework like that before."
- **Stara Shakti** affirmed: "This could be a TED talk."
- **Doug Snyder** challenged you: "Jasmine, use your framework. I want to hear, what is the one thing, your one thing that you want to do, and we'll check in."
- **Julie Dorshkind** connected it: "The language is so key. The question 'what would make today successful' versus 'what do I need to get done' - completely different energy."

**Your evolution:**
- Started with: Presenting a generic question framework for productivity
- Ended with: Iterated to more specific version after Doug's challenge; committed to applying it herself
- Catalyst: Doug's challenge to use her own framework

**You credited:**
- **Doug Snyder** — Earlier input that helped refine the question
