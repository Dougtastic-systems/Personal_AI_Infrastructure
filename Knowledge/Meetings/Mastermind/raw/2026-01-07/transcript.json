So one thing that's been working for me a little bit, just to start thinking differently about it, because part of it was, am I thinking in a way that's helpful around this, is I just asked this basic question. like, what evolutionary, what system response, if I was a theoretician, would say somebody that's my age that's been practicing the dopamine fire hose process my entire right? And what kind of good outcomes could I use? It's something that I will do. I will deep dive. I will follow my curiosity. I am driven to figure out how it works. But yet unstructured and unfocused in every direction except one way, you know, it's very frustrating. So then paying attention to these real drivers and some Sometimes they expose the things I'm not doing and some of the shame around that, but just embracing a little bit and noticing, I keep coming back to the same kind of thing. I keep coming back to the same kind of thing. What kind of lifestyle could I have, and that includes work and friends and what I do, that would reward me for this thing if I had a little more structure around it, a little more process? And it's hard. So I think, especially when it's job-changing job versus what you do in purpose, but, you know, listening to those, I'm clearly motivated in some ways, but yet I get blocked and stopped.",

Yeah, Greg, just trying to figure out how to stack things together where you're intrinsically motivated, do it, and the exercise by itself stinks, and of course we have these opinions about what we should do. So my formulas, it took a while to get there, but to go every morning at 6 a.m., and I go hike up a local hill that's right outside my house, so I'm lucky that way. But I do some movement and talk with people and wake up and talk about interesting ideas, so I get four things in once. But those things allow the exercise to become a habit. The exercise never, it stunk. Who wants to get up in the morning? Well, I got up because I was going to support my buddy. And then connection, and then feeling good. good. .",
