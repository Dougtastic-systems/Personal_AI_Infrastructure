One of the things I've discovered about myself, though, I used to put half-hour alarms for when I had to leave to go, because I was driving places, right, so it's time, when we went to everything online, I changed that to 10 minutes, because if you give me a half-hour, I can easily get involved in something and forget, so, and now I've actually changed my, most of my alarms to five minutes before an appointment, because it's still enough time for me to get a glass of water, but I still get there on time, but it's not enough time for me to get too deep in into something else, and I actually still try to sweep something into the five minutes.

I need to, you know, but I also need long blocks of deep work to do this thing, you know? Okay. And a first principle would be breaking it down. And what's not clear there is that I'm looking for first principles that if I do them, I'll pick up other first principles and maybe secondary and third ones that, you know, affect so that I'm trying to get something that. Captures the essence and do that. Look for that thing. So as an example of a carmaker that makes electric cars, who the founder has been in the news quite a bit in the last year and a half for a lot of crazy reasons, right? One of the things he did when he was analyzing whether or not to start Tesla cars or to go into that business was not, I'm gonna get stuck on how expensive batteries were for these cars, right? Because they really weren't out there. In fact, if you look at what those car batteries are, they actually look like AA batteries. Yep. It's just a giant, giant number of them, right, in one pack. But what he did was, as a decision matrix, he went and said, hey, how expensive are the raw materials? And how expensive is it to make? And wow, I'm paying a giant amount of markup for this. So it makes it very difficult to have this car business to rely on an external supplier for these batteries. It's worth it to build our own capacity because it is a foundational first principle about the product we're offering, which is an electric car, so I better have a great supply of batteries, and I need to control costs, and his question was, how expensive are the raw materials and how much you make it? turns out, oh, this is way, way important to engage in, so different ways of looking what's the problem, like when you were talking about your enrollment thing, and Melissa say, hey, it sounds kind of like an enrollment party, I know somebody did something like that, and you go, it is kind of, because what? It's a party, I want people to want to be here, there's something good about it, there's a first principle about how do you market, know, it's not, do you blast everybody, do you send an email, do you spend a lot of time crafting the perfect message? No, a first principle would be, let me connect with my people early and often, and listen to what they say, and reflect it back and see if anybody else wants it too, because they told you, Yeah, I like this. And you go, that's what I was hoping to give you. Great. Hey, anybody else who wants that? So a first principle about marketing is not figuring out a marketing campaign, but do it with your people and then see what they say and go, hey, this is what we're doing over here. Anybody else want to do this? A very different way of marketing. So a first principle instead of, oh, am I supposed to do all the things that marketing means? And you may not be a lot of expertise in that. And it's really, hey, you that are appropriate for this, come on over. And if it's not for you, not a problem. But this is probably not for you. That's great. So that's how to think about some of these first principles. So in this use case here is we make assumptions about stuff. What are they really? And then we can go, what can I change here?",
