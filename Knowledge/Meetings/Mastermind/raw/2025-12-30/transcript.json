And so we're here at a meeting discussing interesting things, sometimes getting insights and go, wow, somebody said something pretty amazing there, and you credit them. go, wow, that really, that was really important. I want that to be available three weeks from now, when we forget about all this stuff, to go, oh, I had, that was my thought. I was inspired by this person. It kind of matters to do this, because the normal life doesn't get that, but the premise is how do we show that in a way that, like, lets you know, yeah, I did something. So that's where I land on that, because we have that, because so much of my work is that last mile execution, right? I did all the work, actually. I got it all done. But yet, somehow, the people that need to know about it, I haven't quite crossed that finish line. So I look unreliable. I look at all those things that you've all felt. And I'm like, okay, I've to work on this thing, this taking actual stuff that actually happened and make it here, it's done, and then you can move on to the new thing. Our work should be our documentation. So we'll keep working on that. So we'll do that. Anyways, want to stop. Rick and I got on this morning in our exercise call that we get together a couple days a week. And And- We were talking about a couple things that was pretty interesting to us about, hey, how to do things, right? And I brought up a podcast I listened to that I'll share later on because I don't want to focus actually on the podcast and the people, but it was a concept about, for doing things, the power of new start and thinking, oh, New Year's is coming up. I don't know how many times you guys have had some conversation in head, okay, after the New Year's, this happens, I'm different, something's going on, maybe you're like, I'm going to do something different. So I thought maybe it'd be kind of interesting for us to kind of kick off today with that and then shift over. So I'll want to cut it off so we give David and shift over to back to the format we did last week where we did, you know, five, you know, five minutes, like, hey, this is what's going on with me, kind of share what's going on everywhere you're stuck and kind of be able to do a round robin of that. And be able to have David up top of the queue for that, so watching the clock there. So is everybody cool with that? All right, so let's kick it off. New start. What does it mean when you do that? Would you guys think about how do you guys do new starts when it gets so chaotic that you declare bankruptcy on everything, right? You're like, I can't deal with this anymore. I got to start fresh. Or when it really benefits you having a new start, like, okay, I arranged all the puzzle pieces and it wasn't quite right. Let's reset everything and then try building again with the same things. What happens, right? So you're not throwing everything away, but it allows you to clear what's happening for you. So I don't know, Rick, you had a couple thoughts on it, so I throw that out to you and then we'll get people to talk about it. like, hey, what does this mean to you?",

And I do actually have a worksheet here I'll try to find and drop it in the chat window. Maybe I'll do that right now. Let's see if it will work. It's just something that a person used to do with me in a business group I was in, where we would figure out what our major life categories were and identify. This is just something I had Anthropik do really quickly in five minutes before the meeting, so don't take it too seriously. But the, if we have all these. is What I Categories, the PDF, hopefully you can see it in the window there, work and career, relationships, all these different things, if we can put in the first column how we're allocating our time or our energy, if you'd rather do it that way, right now, put some percentage for work and career in there, and then work your way down to the bottom of the list and somehow make sure everything is in there. So the, the center column there is for what you're actually doing now, and you might find some things that really aren't in there, and then the right hand column would be what, you know, if you had a perfect world, how would you distribute these things, because we all have limited brain power, limited time, mean, it's just limits all over the place, right, and we have to learn how to allocate within them to have the best life we can.",

But the, you know, that feeling of it didn't come together makes it, like, kryptonite to come back and touch it again. So, how do you come back and touch it again?",

If you just log it out, and you're exhausted, and you go to the gym and you work out for three hours, even though you've been sedentary, you come back, you just feel awful, and you know, of course you're not going to go back. You might be self-disciplined and get yourself to go back a few times, but you're going to give it up pretty quick. But, for example, if you were to drive to the gym, it takes 15 minutes to get there, and then you do a five-minute workout, and then you drive back, you're going to have so much cognitive dissonance saying, hey, that was really, I feel kind of foolish. I need to go back there and finish that, but you don't right there. You say, no, this is Monday, I'll go back on Wednesday, and you'll be eager to go back on Wednesday, as opposed to dreading going back. And I think, in general, if we quit before we're exhausted, it's better. Again, going back to the beginning, before we run our battery all the way down.",

So I sat down every day at my computer and did work, but I didn't do the second part, which was actually applied jobs because I didn't finish the resume.

But white whale means, like, it's this, you know, quest, this obsession to defeat it, that, you know, I don't want to give up on the idea of what I was chasing, and which was, like, using ChatGPT to go over all my old documents and stuff and come up with all these good insights and metrics and data, proof points to show on my resume resume. Because we're supposed to have outcome and impact-based bullets. I just saw someone in the chat ask about WAGO.

I've so far I shot two out of the three, and what I learned about myself during the process is I like writing the scripts. I don't love being on camera. I don't hate it. I don't love it. I'm kind of neutral, but I kind of hate the editing process. It's a little bit tedious. Would love to have the ability to outsource that in the future or even clone myself. That's why I've been watching like Julie McCoy's videos. But anyway, something that I wanted to run past the group if they're okay with it. So I kind of like have these creative bursts that happen kind of spontaneously. And that's why it's kind of great to have my phone on me because then I can just voice note into chat and GBT. And so one of the things that I had been thinking about is how does my brain work, right? Like, I'm very good at... I have the tendency to over-model future possibilities and outcomes, and I discovered that it's kind of a double-edged sword, because on the one hand, it makes me a formidable chess player, but on the other hand, it's like, why do I wake up every day in this spiral where I'm trying to solve every possible future in order to prevent harm? And what I mean by that is, some people might call it rumination, right? What could go wrong today? What should I prioritize? What if I choose wrong? So I recently shared with Rick that I just thought of a question, and I think it works, and I'm not sure why it works, which is that interrupts that spiral, which is what would make today successful. So if it's okay to share my screen. I actually put something together. Let me see. You do. You You ... Thank you. I'm trying to share.",

      "text": "Okay, you guys see my screen? No, Okay, this is why I think it works. It's the question that turns stuck into action. Okay, so I was trying to describe to him kind of like, I'm like listening to everyone, but I'm also trying to understand like, what is really happening? What is the underlying sentiment of what's happening when we get stuck in this endless thought rumination? So I think that this is what it is. It's emotion. And then we tell ourselves a story about that emotion. And then we judge ourselves, and then we end up being stuck. And so the reason why we keep looping every time we try to push ourselves to commit to an action is because that feeling demands an explanation. That explanation turns into a verdict about you, and then that verdict makes starting feel unsafe. And so I thought about how somebody mentioned in the group, I don't know if it was last week or the week before, that they are kind of tired of these, you know, generic product. And so I was thinking to myself, why doesn't that work? And I'm like, well, maybe it's because we don't need generic productivity hacks. We actually need nervous system interventions. And so I think if I had to take a stab at it, by the way, Rick, thought about this question a ton more after our call yesterday. If I had to take a stab at it, my guess would be that this question more or less functions like a nervous system intervention. So when your intent and output, when they don't align, action itself becomes emotionally charged. So task initiation carries shame, fear, and memory. So it's kind of like, so think about the last time that you attempted a task, and then you reflected on it afterwards, like, why didn't you start it? Is it because you're anxious because, oh, if I can't do it, this proves that I'm incompetent? Or... Or if I do it, then maybe people will judge me. Or some people may not want to commit, right, because they think it's irreversible. And then some people are just feeling like this sense of past pain, like last time I tried, I got criticized, right? So that's what I think it is. think eventually it gets to a point where a task initiation carries shame, fear and memory. So like, I think the reason why generic productivity advice doesn't work is because we're solving for the wrong problem. So if someone says, like, you're lazy, that implies that you don't care and that you have low motivation. But if we're saying that task initiation carries shame, fear and memory, then that means that that's a conditioned threat response, right? That's a nervous system state. That's you saying to yourself, I care, but starting feel. So my system is just going to hit the brakes on that. So I decided I was going to redefine the problem. So instead of like how do I get motivated, how do I rebuild trust with action? So this is what I showed Rick yesterday. And I said, I think it's really been working for me. I've got this acrylic board on my refrigerator, and I literally wrote the question down, which is, what would make today successful? So on the left side, I noticed that I get into these...",

This is kind of the mental loops that I'm seeing myself getting stuck in, which is my brain keeps running these scenarios. I'm trying to understand cause and effect. I'm trying to avoid mistakes, but the thinking never finishes. And then oftentimes I also find myself getting stuck before starting. So nothing feels rewarding yet. Starting feels harder than thinking. These intense emotions... Oh, wait. Why did it? Skip. These intense emotions have this tendency to grab my attention and I stay stuck in my head. Right? So why this question, why I think it works is it limits the overthinking. It creates a tangible stopping point and it defines like what's enough for And then on the right side, I have what this question actually does. So it shrinks the day. You don't have to solve your whole life. What's good enough just for today? It creates direction, so you choose what matters today. And then distractions become easier to spot. And when I say that, I mean that this isn't just a question that interrupts the thought rumination in the morning. This is a question that you can continue to refer back to during the day. So hopefully distractions become easier to spot. And you can now course correct without guilt. And it also makes your progress feel real. So small wins count, completion beats perfection, and then momentum comes from clarity. Oh, wait. And then I kind of made this one shortly before the meeting. So remember the emotional loop that I discussed in the beginning. I'll one. I I'm Thank Emotion turns into a story, right, why is this happening, that becomes self-judgment, what it says about me, and then you become stuck, but if we interrupt it with what would make today successful, now we're rerouting it into a plan, so what this question I think unintentionally does is it forces a little bit of introspection, and it asks us, it reminds me to ask myself, how much energy do I have right now? Let's also I'm forced to look at my constraints, which is my time and my resources., It forces me to define success as a realistic small one. Then I take an action, and then that creates momentum Okay. So a good Daily Success question is small enough to start, clear enough to know when it's done, and then meaningful enough to count. And for ADHD, it... creates a clear wind condition, it allows for fast closure, and also gives you the micro successes that are emotionally legible. And then what I also told Rick was, I find that when I answer this question, more often times than not, what I'm listing kind of falls into one of these three categories, which is, like, what are all the meaningful actions that we take every single day? So the first being maintain the present. So this is the stuff that keeps your life from sliding backward. Or what are the things that we're doing in our day-to-day life to prevent those future fires from occurring? So under this box, I put home and daily logistics, health basics, admin that prevents problems. These things tend to keep you stable. And then the second box, which is what I think we're all really focused on in here, is investing in the future. That's learning and skill building, creating or writing long-term projects, career steps, and then the last, which is to restore and regulate. That protects your capacity to keep going. So these are the things that actually keep you feeling fulfilled and human, rest and recovery, movement and joy, connection and come. And that's all I have for you guys today.",

I mean, I did some things, but I also didn't do a lot of things, and I'm feeling a little emotionally overwhelmed right now because of having to take charge of a situation to help my partner that really isn't my situation to be, you know, taking charge of, but somebody had to do it. And she's feeling overwhelmed, related to caregiving for her mother and, you know, who's aging, and I had to do some, like, some dynamics shifting over there.

Thank Thank Thank think that Christmas holiday just kind of took me out of, I feel unfocused, I feel like I gotta refocus and recommit to, like, work right now, and I just feel a little, like, a little further. I'm being pulled in different directions and, um, . Okay, sorry. So, um, I did set up meeting with Melissa Melissa, right after this at 2.30, and, um, you were gonna talk about conversations with Melissa, and, uh, that, you know, hopefully will help, you know, me promote the decolonizing therapy group. And, um, I, I just now finished going through all the email recaps of the past few weeks meetings. I don't know why, I just, um, I'm trying to get used to a new VA, you know, who started last week, but is sick this week. They're not doing work, right? What am I supposed to do here? So I'm still doing client scheduling anyway, and seeing clients, and so I want to revisit that concept that Melissa said about the live enrollment parties, so maybe we could talk about it and it'll help get it back into my brain. I'm like, oh yeah, I forgot about that idea. That's a great idea, and I remember being so excited. Family drama can sometimes pull you out of yourself, and I think I just got pulled out a little bit too much. So I just finished sketching up on those emails. I wanted to follow up with Bernice about some of our kind of common work and cross-promoting the group and also JoJo about voice singing stuff and imposter syndrome. I didn't do either of those. So I would need to add that to my... I just added it to my... to my... to my... my... But I have been posting the graphic and I need to send some direct emails to a couple of people who have access to groups that would be really interested in that. And one of them is Kiana. People I know from the Diversity Committee from my local therapist group, and it's a lot of therapist followers in her group. So anyway, I need to post it on the Business School for Therapists because that's also a very big community of thousands of therapists. I'm a neurodiverse therapist support group facilitator that I created for therapists. And people know me there, you know. So I've got to tell people what I'm doing. What I'm struggling with is, besides getting pulled out, you know, from myself and my work, the family stuff, to be is I to this, don't struggling with is... Well, staying focused too. That's a problem. What was I going to say? Oh, yeah. There's still a part of me that's just... I'm just very emotional right now. A part of me that's still afraid to put myself out there.

And my business, my new business, it has to be based on collaboration with people, with working with other people and doing things together. And that's how I'm going to, I think, finally create wealth. Like, I don't, I'm not, I'm not doing this myself anymore. I'm not. I got a business coach. I got, I started Team Shock 2 Fire Rising. Like, a team. I think that happened this week, too. Oh, God, that's a really great thing, actually. And I got, like, Susie, who did the song circle, goddess chant song circle with me. She's like. We were supposed to meet last night, but she had to reschedule. That's another thing I tried to do, but anyway, yeah. So she's going to be like that team member with that focus, and then I've got the business coach. And actually, I think I may have mentioned, I'm thinking about also offering one of the other things that's coming through. I want to offer some kind of like anger, rage, release, dance parties kind of thing where people can get really angry and like, you know, shake it out loud and, you know, anyway, blah, blah, blah. I have a friend, a really good long-term friend. I bet we've been friends for probably, I don't know, 10, 15 years. And she used to be a DJ. And she made me a track. I asked for 15 to 20 minutes. She made me a track for like four hours on Spotify. And she was like, just take what you want. It's all music to get in touch with and release anger. And Rage. I have to listen to it now. I've been starting to listen to it, and I didn't figure out what I'm going to do, but I think, I think that's, yeah, she's going to be now like my, you know, musical kind of coordinator or something, because she's just got so much, she's got so much music up there that she can access than me. So, just did it like that. So, this is what I mean. I've got people everywhere who are willing to help me. I just need to feel safe enough to be seen, to put myself out there to ask for help, and then to really receive. That's my goal right now.",
