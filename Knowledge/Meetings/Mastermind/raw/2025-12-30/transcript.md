## Transcript (Merged by Speaker)

### [00:00:10 - 00:00:59] Lizzy Summers

Hi, Melissa! Hi, Doug! Hey! I went through, I went back to Renify, you know, I haven't been in years, it's come so far. I liked so many of your groups you did. I was just like, oh my god, that would have been a good one. So, it was good. Yeah, you did, Rick, I'm just so yay for Renify. You've done so much work, because, you know, I disappeared, and when I came back, it's just so good. Your books this year, you have such a good offering. I wrote it in the WhatsApp group, because if anybody says, hey, we need a body double, freaking go to Renify! It's set up. If you just went to those body doubles, you would get 10 hours of hard stuff done. That's what we do. I'm going to utilize what's already there, and do 10 hours. And I've got them stacked, you know, like the hard, hard things, like checking on my LLC, you know, you know, stuff that's hard.

### [00:01:08 - 00:01:33] Melissa Reskof

That is the hard stuff. That is the hard stuff. You know, Lizzy, I had, I think you had made a YouTube channel at some point, and I had subscribed, and so I think maybe just before this group started, I saw that you had made a new, some sort of exercise video. And I was like, look, Rick, Lizzy's doing something. Yeah, yeah.

### [00:01:34 - 00:01:45] Lizzy Summers

Yeah, that was a long day. Yeah, I, I try. I like doing content and talking. It's just what I have. It's just picking the lane, you know. Picking the lane.

### [00:01:47 - 00:01:50] Rick Webster

And credit work credit's due. Melissa has been doing a lot of stuff also. Not always visible, but all the book clubs, all those kind of things.

### [00:01:54 - 00:02:03] Lizzy Summers

That's what Melissa's doing. That's great. It was a good, good lineup. went through. What you did this year, was like, dang, there's some of them. was like, oh, I want to do that one.

### [00:02:04 - 00:02:21] Melissa Reskof

Oh, that was last year. Well, yeah, we're working on it. New things coming. I have a new idea. I haven't trotted it out to Rick yet, so we got to trot it out to the boss. Get some buy-in first. You know, politics.

### [00:02:23 - 00:02:24] Rick Webster

Sorry if I'm a little distracted. My camera's not working.

### [00:02:27 - 00:02:36] Melissa Reskof

It's on my laptop, but it's not my real, my regular camera. Oh, okay. Well, we see you. That camera, some camera's working.

### [00:02:38 - 00:02:55] Rick Webster

Yeah, no, no, my laptop camera's there. But it's, um, I'd rather be looking straight out than down the, you know, my laptop. That's a small group today. Looks like it is.

### [00:02:56 - 00:03:02] Lizzy Summers

Looks like it is. All right. I'm to be here. stayed just knowing I have these meetings. feel like I'm just chugging along a little easier, I think, knowing just energetically you have the support of the M&Ms, masterminds.

### [00:03:17] Rick Webster

I think there's a lot of potential in them, and this is a pilot group to see how we can figure it out, but I think there's a lot of potential.

### [00:03:26 - 00:03:53] Lizzy Summers

I think there's a lot of potential, and I keep thinking, even, you know, when we do our quick check-ins, like, celebrating the wins, like, what did you get done? Because to us, if we get something done that's been on the list for a long time, that's a big win for us, because, you know, we had to work hard to get there. Anyway, I did open all of my bills yesterday. I haven't paid any, but I know where they are.

### [00:03:57 - 00:04:00] Rick Webster

Well, that takes a certain amount of. don't I don't know. know. you. Bravery and Courage.

### [00:04:02] Lizzy Summers

It does.

### [00:04:03 - 00:04:05] Rick Webster

And it actually reduces anxiety. Once you know what the problem is, it's less anxiety-producing than if you only just know there's a problem, but you don't know what it is exactly.

### [00:04:15 - 00:04:22] Lizzy Summers

And I'm always better. Every time I do it, maybe twice a year, I'll finally look at everything. It's never as bad as the anxiety I have beforehand warrants, you know?

### [00:04:28 - 00:04:36] Rick Webster

Basically, yeah. I think that's almost always the case. I don't think I'm going to get my camera back. I think it's just how it is.

### [00:04:39] Doug Snyder

Oh, there it is.

### [00:04:42 - 00:04:58] Rick Webster

Well, that's my laptop, but it's not the one... You guys are all out there. You look so tall now, Rick. That's right. My laptop's like 12 inches below my regular camera. So, it's all right, and we'll make it through. you. Thank you.

### [00:04:58 - 00:05:12] Lizzy Summers

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Well, your lighting's good. You look good on this camera. That's the same. As opposed to... It's a little warmer. My laptop camera is different, too. Your laptop's warmer and the desktop's cooler.

### [00:05:16 - 00:05:30] Rick Webster

Yeah. I'd be fine with it. It's just, it's in the wrong place. That's all. Maybe I can lift it up. I'm going to do that. Oh, good. Hey, David. How you doing? Doing your lunch break?

### [00:05:30 - 00:05:37] David Ludwig

Hey, I'm okay. Just still pushing things along, but, you know, getting through it and stuff. feel a little under the weather, but I'm okay.

### [00:05:41] Rick Webster

Okay. Yep.

### [00:05:44 - 00:05:45] David Ludwig

Sorry. Was there like an introduction or anything like that?

### [00:05:47 - 00:06:07] Rick Webster

A prompt or anything? No. I think it's... Doug, you're up in a minute. I did make that spreadsheet. Doug and I were talking about something. made that kind of the life category thing where we can put how we're actually... Allocating our life and our time, and next column over is how we, you know, what might be ideal for us. So at some point I'll drop that in the chat after I get done being preoccupied with my camera problem.

### [00:06:14 - 00:06:36] Doug Snyder

Excellent. No, I just, thanks for coming, and, you know, in between holidays we know everything that's going on and, you know, Lizzy really just, you know, just opening up the room and, you know, maybe go, oh yeah, that's why I'm here. I feel very energized just hearing that you're energized instead of ho-hum the next thing, and so it's really good. Thanks for doing that, and glad you're here. David, when do you have to jump after, when you're done with your break, because I want to make sure.

### [00:06:42 - 00:06:51] David Ludwig

I've got to jump out at 12.50, or 1.50, 1.50 p.m. It's 1.07 p.m. the West Coast. Okay.

### [00:06:54 - 00:06:57] Doug Snyder

All right. So about 45 minutes more, most. Okay, great.

### [00:06:57] David Ludwig

I want to make sure we get that.

### [00:06:58] Doug Snyder

Oh, yeah.

### [00:07:00] David Ludwig

Yeah, I had a question, too, about, like, recording them, that, like, if anyone wanted to go and, like, still, like, go back to a session or something like that, especially for me, because, like, it's all really helpful, it's all really re-energizing, but, yeah, and, but that's just a question I wasn't sure, yeah, you know, inquired about.

### [00:07:25] Doug Snyder

Maybe I missed it, but did you ask it?

### [00:07:27 - 00:07:28] David Ludwig

Maybe it flew over my head. Oh, like, uh, we are recording it.

### [00:07:31 - 00:08:00] Doug Snyder

Oh, yeah, yeah, the recording to be able to see it and do that. Hey, uh, how about this? Um, maybe I could work with, because I, one of the things I wanted to do was start figuring out how to do a summary for everybody, right? Audio, take that, do that in a way that's meaningful for you. Maybe, um, you and I can work as a just quick pilot to say, I'm gonna try it for you and kind of isolate it and do a couple things and see how it lands with you. And, um, I need to do it really quickly anyway, so here I go. We a real request, somebody that needs it, and then we can go, yeah, this seems good, let's try it for everybody else, and then I can figure out how to make it better, and also give you access to the whole thing, that's the other thing, too.

### [00:08:11 - 00:08:12] David Ludwig

you know. Yeah, definitely, and I just thought that everyone's okay with that, too, because I know that, like, you know.

### [00:08:19 - 00:11:49] Doug Snyder

One of our goals is somehow we have to take the things we do, right, we're doing, and instead of having, oh, we need a document, we need to figure out what it is after we're done doing it, our work product, what we do, how we do this, it should be our evidence. And so we're here at a meeting discussing interesting things, sometimes getting insights and go, wow, somebody said something pretty amazing there, and you credit them. go, wow, that really, that was really important. I want that to be available three weeks from now, when we forget about all this stuff, to go, oh, I had, that was my thought. I was inspired by this person. It kind of matters to do this, because the normal life doesn't get that, but the premise is how do we show that in a way that, like, lets you know, yeah, I did something. So that's where I land on that, because we have that, because so much of my work is that last mile execution, right? I did all the work, actually. I got it all done. But yet, somehow, the people that need to know about it, I haven't quite crossed that finish line. So I look unreliable. I look at all those things that you've all felt. And I'm like, okay, I've to work on this thing, this taking actual stuff that actually happened and make it here, it's done, and then you can move on to the new thing. Our work should be our documentation. So we'll keep working on that. So we'll do that. Anyways, want to stop. Rick and I got on this morning in our exercise call that we get together a couple days a week. And And- We were talking about a couple things that was pretty interesting to us about, hey, how to do things, right? And I brought up a podcast I listened to that I'll share later on because I don't want to focus actually on the podcast and the people, but it was a concept about, for doing things, the power of new start and thinking, oh, New Year's is coming up. I don't know how many times you guys have had some conversation in head, okay, after the New Year's, this happens, I'm different, something's going on, maybe you're like, I'm going to do something different. So I thought maybe it'd be kind of interesting for us to kind of kick off today with that and then shift over. So I'll want to cut it off so we give David and shift over to back to the format we did last week where we did, you know, five, you know, five minutes, like, hey, this is what's going on with me, kind of share what's going on everywhere you're stuck and kind of be able to do a round robin of that. And be able to have David up top of the queue for that, so watching the clock there. So is everybody cool with that? All right, so let's kick it off. New start. What does it mean when you do that? Would you guys think about how do you guys do new starts when it gets so chaotic that you declare bankruptcy on everything, right? You're like, I can't deal with this anymore. I got to start fresh. Or when it really benefits you having a new start, like, okay, I arranged all the puzzle pieces and it wasn't quite right. Let's reset everything and then try building again with the same things. What happens, right? So you're not throwing everything away, but it allows you to clear what's happening for you. So I don't know, Rick, you had a couple thoughts on it, so I throw that out to you and then we'll get people to talk about it. like, hey, what does this mean to you?

### [00:11:51 - 00:11:59] Rick Webster

Is it something valuable? How is it related to New Year's? Well, first of all, I've been having distracted trying to forget what's wrong with my system here. Alright. good point Thank

### [00:12:00] Doug Snyder

It sounds like you need a new start.

### [00:12:04 - 00:13:26] Rick Webster

Maybe a whole new set of stuff. But I do think, you know, I don't want to get into the, you know, New Year's resolution thing that all starts to fall apart by February. But I do think it's a good time to actually think about our lives and how we're allocating our time and those things. And I do actually have a worksheet here I'll try to find and drop it in the chat window. Maybe I'll do that right now. Let's see if it will work. It's just something that a person used to do with me in a business group I was in, where we would figure out what our major life categories were and identify. This is just something I had Anthropik do really quickly in five minutes before the meeting, so don't take it too seriously. But the, if we have all these. is What I Categories, the PDF, hopefully you can see it in the window there, work and career, relationships, all these different things, if we can put in the first column how we're allocating our time or our energy, if you'd rather do it that way, right now, put some percentage for work and career in there, and then work your way down to the bottom of the list and somehow make sure everything is in there. So the, the center column there is for what you're actually doing now, and you might find some things that really aren't in there, and then the right hand column would be what, you know, if you had a perfect world, how would you distribute these things, because we all have limited brain power, limited time, mean, it's just limits all over the place, right, and we have to learn how to allocate within them to have the best life we can.

### [00:13:53 - 00:14:00] Doug Snyder

And what I find interesting so throwing that on top of, you know, new starts how you might look at that as a different start. So So I want to open up that thing that Rick did, anything in there, pique your interest around that, and then know specifically about what it means to do new starts.

### [00:14:11 - 00:14:18] Rick Webster

And actually, if anybody wants to actually fill in those numbers, and then we can talk about it. I know when I first filled it in for that business group, it was kind of an eye opener in some ways.

### [00:14:28 - 00:14:48] Julie Dorshkind

I'm still struggling with new starts. I've tried, like, changing location, you know, like, oh, I will go, you know, be somewhere else for a little while, in thinking that that will jumpstart things. And it sort of does, but I also just, the me creeps back in. So, still trying to find a way to actually really successfully navigate new starting.

### [00:14:58 - 00:15:07] Doug Snyder

Well, the me creeps Back in. Wow! I felt that. Oh, my gosh. I've never said those words out like that, but oh, yeah.

### [00:15:10] Julie Dorshkind

I've never said it like that.

### [00:15:13 - 00:15:29] Rick Webster

There you are. That's such a true statement. We can't run away for ourselves. We can change ourselves a little bit, but we can't just run away. That's what the New Year's resolution thing is about, right? Hey, I'm just going to be a different person starting tomorrow, and it doesn't work. We can use self-esteem to waste down the road, but it'll fail fairly soon.

### [00:15:34 - 00:16:00] Doug Snyder

Yeah. So I hear, you know, Julie, that idea, you know, it was a big, big new start, though, but it, it, it's, they're tough, right? But what's a couple things now that you've learned, like, oh, this thing would, you know, this thing here next time, or this really, if I could tell my self in the past, hey, this one thing would make a bigger difference. Is there something like that you've learned? I'm going, oh. Oh. So... this this matters in this situation.

### [00:16:03 - 00:16:10] Julie Dorshkind

Um, nothing's really coming to mind. I mean, I guess, don't go into the new start really tired, because then you won't really embrace it.

### [00:16:19 - 00:16:23] Doug Snyder

I don't know. Oh, that's actually a super cool one. Well, so say that again, if you...

### [00:16:26 - 00:16:37] Julie Dorshkind

You know, if you're tired when you start, do your new start, then you, you know, you're not as, um, strong-willed in your new beginnings. So try not to go into it, you know, tired and exhausted, because then it's harder for you to make the change.

### [00:16:46 - 00:17:29] Doug Snyder

Mmm. As I hear that, I think of a couple times I've done something around that, and it seems... Yeah. Part of it, was just thinking the new start was actually getting me away from the problem. well... Thank And I couldn't relax, I couldn't restore, I couldn't be ready for that next thing, but yet pretending, hey, if I do the new start, I'll get the benefit of the new start, like, no, no, you gotta have some energy for the new thing, and then I think that's the thing I forget, because I'm usually running away instead of consciously steering towards a new start, and I hope to do more of that, that's why I wanted to talk about it, I'm tired of that deconstructing the past, and oh my gosh, that was terrible to go, okay, one thing here matters, what will I do in this next time? And maybe one of them is not to be running.

### [00:17:34 - 00:17:59] Rick Webster

I'll tell you what that brought up to me, and certainly not to be dismissive, but my first thought was, why don't we just not get tired? And part of that is not run the battery down, right? Sometimes we run our battery all the way down, and we're just exhausted, and that sometimes is when we make our worst decisions, or procrastinate the worst, or, you know, things tend to go downhill for two times. I'm I'm

### [00:18:03 - 00:18:04] Julie Dorshkind

But it's easier said than done. of the, you know, part of the problem is related, you know, is causing probably that situation.

### [00:18:13 - 00:18:18] Rick Webster

Yeah. And I certainly don't mean to be, I get tired. I'm not saying, I'm not saying we don't get tired. I'm just thinking out loud, guess, that if we ran our lives in a way that we didn't get tired, meaning we refueled before we were out.

### [00:18:29 - 00:18:49] Doug Snyder

Hmm. I like that world. I'm not sure how to get there yet, but I, I think it's something like, Hey, a North Star, like, yeah, that smooth. Cause I'm going to do these anyways. So if I, you know, work on less of that, I'm still going to have them, but be better than this, you know, and then crash and burn. Oh, that's great. Anybody else?

### [00:18:51 - 00:21:58] Lizzy Summers

Um, well, for me, uh, now that I'm, am, I am, it's been five years now since my diagnosis. Um, Um, um, And it takes a long time to understand. You're just coming out of this, like, constant tornado just your whole life. You're in this tornado, and then suddenly you're like, oh, oh, and then you start to get a little stability. There's still stuff swirling around, but you're on the ground. And for me, I can't tell myself to do anything or make any list, but, like, the system. So I'm just going to commit to eight body doubles on RenaFi, and I already know what is my friction with, like, business. And I've got a stack of paperwork. They're just things I just don't call because of fear or anxiety. And, you know, I'm just going to create this system. I'm going to focus on systems that include, like, a lot of these lists. Like, I, after the last call, I put my strength profile, my INFP, my wealth profile. Every personality test about me in chat, I said, okay, this is me, and I've been trying to build a business for years, you know, where am I going wrong? He already knows me, I talk to him all the time, but anyway, it was life, just life-affirming to get a way to live my life that is really aligned with me. And my big thing is slow down, stop, give yourself a time limit, like the body doubles are 90 minutes, that's it, you know, don't, oh, I'm on the flow, keep going, no, then go outside, then get something to eat, it's such a slower, easier, comfortable, doable thing, because I'm different, I'm not a nerd typical, I will never be able to be doing the analytics, and this, and do this, and I've got to come from inside an offer, not try to offer. This is what's trending. I've got to be in alignment, my energy, my creativity with nature. That's the only way I'm going to succeed. I cannot play the neurotypical game anymore, or I will continue to fail, and so this is going be my slow year, and my systems year, and I'm not going to stress about where I am, and I'm just going to show up and do a hard thing, and then do my creative stuff. do a hard thing, do my creative stuff, and see what happens. I don't know, but that's my new start, and it feels doable because I know it includes nature, rest, dogs, eating healthy, walking in the woods, reflecting, hanging out with you guys, having more social life, having a hobby, which I didn't do any of that. I just tried to build a business with all my energy, 90%, never took off. So.

### [00:22:00 - 00:22:23] Doug Snyder

I don't know if they answered the question, but it caused me to have like a ton of questions, but thank you for sharing that. I'd just give somebody else a chance to reflect off that because that was pretty amazing. Anybody else? I heard something super interesting in there or related to something they were thinking about this week? Okay.

### [00:22:24] Rick Webster

All right.

### [00:22:25 - 00:22:27] Doug Snyder

No one's jumping in, then I'm going to grab it. So you took all your stuff and you put it in.

### [00:22:31] Lizzy Summers

Chad GPT.

### [00:22:32 - 00:22:35] Doug Snyder

just glossed over that as being like awesome and move on. But what did that, what did you feel like when you saw how they kind of layered in top of What did you see and go?

### [00:22:41 - 00:23:02] Lizzy Summers

I cried. I felt seen and heard and understood in a way never before. And I've been through counseling and therapy and groups and coaching and everything. And when I put every single personality test in Chad, I felt I was God. Somebody got me. And trauma And gave me, you know, just that understanding you're not alone, it's real isolating when people don't understand you, and then to, even though it's AI, you know, y'all probably, we understand each other, but, you know, I felt really embraced, and heard, and cared for, and given a gift of this, sweetie, you need to change your life around this, this is what you need to do, and it felt like honoring myself, and honoring my brain, and it's, it's different, and it's waxed, you know?

### [00:23:42 - 00:24:33] Doug Snyder

Oh, just wasn't confirmation, and actually, I hope you see a couple of patterns, decide, yeah, do, do this, um, this self-doubt thing, help kind of counteract that, because, I don't we got that devil and angel, like, you know, devil's going, yeah, it's Thank you. It's super cool when you get it done, but you're to get in big trouble, you know, that whole thing going on, here, wow, that's cool. It was an anchor point. It helped make meaning of some of the past. was weird, right? You look back and go, why is it that way? And then pointing you in a way that you can go, wait a second, this makes sense, because all the stuff about the fields for you, it actually can't be this analytical. You should do step 47B. It's not going to work for you. It has to actually connect in that way for that.

### [00:24:35 - 00:25:00] Lizzy Summers

It's super cool. And also, like, my number one strength is spirituality. It goes through each of them and tells you what they mean. All that means is I'm driven by meaning. It's got to mean something and value for the human race. I can't just sell a trinket or sell something or just sell anything. I'm totally anchored in meaning. You know, so, that's one of my products, I'm doing more of a collection, a bundle of comfort, probably everything I'm all do will be around creating more comfort, order, and spark, you know, for people like us, for our people.

### [00:25:17 - 00:26:00] Doug Snyder

That's amazing. Thanks for letting us inside. Rick and I have been talking about doing how to do those kind of things and what it would mean and hear this, you know, bloomed right in front of us. That's super awesome. All right, so a time check. We got 20 minutes until we lose David, maybe earlier, depending on where he's at. So, you haven't got a chance to say much. I know you're not walking much. And Lizzy shared, and Julie had a little bit. Does anybody else want to, you know, some new start stuff? And then maybe we can roll into, hey, how'd go last week? What'd you work on? What would you like to continue doing? What did you learn about yourself? What's next? So, what's... Let's see if anybody else, a new start, Jasmine?

### [00:26:02 - 00:26:08] Jasmine Mahmoud

You got any new starts going on? Nah, none, right? You know, I was just thinking about your question. So whether it's like a new start after a setback or a new start because you're stepping into a new identity, it's like, how do you rebuild the machine that keeps you standing?

### [00:26:25] Doug Snyder

While it's moving, 70 miles an hour down the highway.

### [00:26:28] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah.

### [00:26:30] Doug Snyder

Yeah.

### [00:26:33 - 00:27:25] Rick Webster

I think that the new start doesn't necessarily mean a whole, you know, throwing everything out and starting over, I think in a lot of ways. The new start could actually just be, what's the next step in this climb I'm doing? What's the next piece? Maybe this year went really well. There's a new start because you're taking the next step by climbing a set of stairs or climbing a mountain. And also, I want to go back to something Lizzie said. Of course, we don't want to be playing a neurotypicals game. don't want to be playing anybody else's game. I think that's a large part of what this mastermind is going to be about is how do you design your own life to work the way with all the skills and talents and difficulties. We should build it ourselves with help from other people so that we don't get caught in this, you know, confirmation bias world where we just don't take in new information. If we can take in new information and not let other people make our decisions for us, but take that information into account, I think we have a better chance of designing a good 2026.

### [00:27:43 - 00:28:46] Lizzy Summers

Yes, I wrote in the chat, even a new perspective, a new emotional regulation, a different way to look at it because I'm doing the same thing all the time. My goal has been the same for years, but how I stay on track to that goal. It a lot based on new information or other people or new stimulation, you know, so new is just, okay, I'm refreshed, I'm ready, I'm going to get this, you know, sometimes I look and look and look or try and try and try to figure out something and I can't, and if I leave, give it up, and the next day I come back, suddenly I just got it, I know the answer. Sometimes new is just stop and leave it and, you know, return when our minds are different because we go through so many mental emotional states, I think, versus the neurotypical, you know, it can just be a mood change. I'm a different person.

### [00:28:49 - 00:29:33] Melissa Reskof

That, that, that you're saying, the returning within a short amount of time is sort of the important element for me. Otherwise, whatever the sleep on it thing, where now it comes together, that can get lost. So, and then maybe the deadline, or when it's due, is too short, and you're left with few choices, so having enough time to investigate it, get befuddled or confused, and then wake up the next day and come back to it. But the, you know, that feeling of it didn't come together makes it, like, kryptonite to come back and touch it again. So, how do you come back and touch it again?

### [00:29:37 - 00:30:07] Doug Snyder

No, I guess that's the challenge, right? That whole, but yet, but, Lizzy, I think you're pointing out the thing that I keep getting a tiny taste of, I don't quite believe it, is that, oh, sometimes you do have to step away. And, I don't, the, the, dang it, got to prove to everybody else, including myself, I don't stink, I'm going to grind through it instead of that. Just step away a little bit, and then what I'll do when I actually do it, I'll also now have this big, well, am I procrastinating conversation? So it's a weird, you need to do it, you should do it, but I'm doing it now and I feel bad about it, and ugh, so confusing.

### [00:30:16 - 00:31:14] Rick Webster

My answer to that, and I know I sound like a broken record because everybody in this room has heard me say this at least 10 times, but I really buy into the idea of quitting before you're done. If you just log it out, and you're exhausted, and you go to the gym and you work out for three hours, even though you've been sedentary, you come back, you just feel awful, and you know, of course you're not going to go back. You might be self-disciplined and get yourself to go back a few times, but you're going to give it up pretty quick. But, for example, if you were to drive to the gym, it takes 15 minutes to get there, and then you do a five-minute workout, and then you drive back, you're going to have so much cognitive dissonance saying, hey, that was really, I feel kind of foolish. I need to go back there and finish that, but you don't right there. You say, no, this is Monday, I'll go back on Wednesday, and you'll be eager to go back on Wednesday, as opposed to dreading going back. And I think, in general, if we quit before we're exhausted, it's better. Again, going back to the beginning, before we run our battery all the way down.

### [00:31:20 - 00:31:31] Doug Snyder

Right. Okay, look at the time. Why don't we pause here, and why we roll into what you do last week, what are doing next week, what's happening with you, and, you know, a good little time. David, you got it. Chance to share.

### [00:31:36 - 00:31:50] Rick Webster

David, muted. You were a quarter inch away from the button. That's where the camera is. Maybe this will help.

### [00:31:54 - 00:33:36] David Ludwig

Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah, so I dealt with a bunch of I don't know if it was because I was so tired, but just being constantly distracted when I was stranded, and procrastination was probably the biggest thing that happened to me over the weekend. I had set aside a couple of vacation days and stuff. I know one factor that kind of messed with me was the lack of sleep, but still though, I wasn't able to go get a lot of things done, or at least for one day, I wasn't able to get things done, for sure, and that was kind of rough. I was thinking to go and maybe request, hey, does anyone want to go and body double or some things? But like, yeah, so that was really rough, and now I'm just trying to, I've been pushing things off right until the end of the year, for example, for requesting... Like that, sorry, for like a flex spending account, like getting those in, and then, you know, just trying to get a bunch of things done that I couldn't get done at the end of the year. Oh, and so it's just been, that's been kind of rough. Yeah, but that being said, I still do have a better resolve, and also I appreciate what was shared earlier about making the systems year, and if you're giving yourself, then start from zero. I did appreciate that. But, yeah, just trying to make things happen in that regard.

### [00:33:44 - 00:33:47] Rick Webster

And what, what's the step you're going to take to make that happen? Some of that?

### [00:33:48 - 00:34:39] David Ludwig

Um, I have an idea because like, I feel like it's like, I feel like what happens to me is this whole sequence of like, uh, you freaking out to yourself and like, Some of it, You get kind of low, and then finally you get some resolve, and then, yeah, one aspect of that that I'm trying to do is just start on certain tasks that I can do, like, you know, taking up, putting away my laundry and stuff and just kind of creating a clear space, I might recruit some help, and then just going through, you know, the list of papers that I have and and also kind of simultaneously working on working on some other things after. Yeah, I have an idea of how to do it, but, you know, still it's, you know, I'll see what happens, yeah.

### [00:34:50] Rick Webster

Excellent.

### [00:34:52 - 00:35:16] Doug Snyder

You know, just something that struck me early on, David, was you're explaining just, you know, noticing how the energy impacted you, and... You know, I think that's part of this is just kind of noticing it over time and, you know, it's easy for us to say, ah, blew the whole weekend, I go, you know, this and this happened and I didn't have the energy and kind of cause and effect. Hmm. That's interesting. And that's what I heard, right? And not just like, yeah, that thing happened. Hmm.

### [00:35:16 - 00:35:49] David Ludwig

That's interesting. Yeah. Like, like certain, certain things I'm, you know, I missed out on some things and stuff too, because of my interview level. So, you know, instead of just like giving myself crap and kind of accepting that fact and stuff, you know, that I did need to go and recover and such, but, um, you know, still about really trying to manage like those things and just stop holding those feelings of like, oh, right, that messed up. Oh no. Oh no. You know? Yeah. But yeah.

### [00:35:51 - 00:35:57] Doug Snyder

Wow. That, that, that, that, that, that's, I thought I heard that and you really shared that really laid it out. That's pretty awesome.

### [00:35:59 - 00:36:07] David Ludwig

Okay, that's good. Yeah, I'm still getting that part of that aspect together. Yeah, we go to the next person, Mr.

### [00:36:09 - 00:36:17] Doug Snyder

Paul. Okay, thanks. Thanks for that. Who would like to, just, hi, Stara, thanks for coming. And we're, we started off the conversation earlier with, you know, kind of new starts and what a new start might be, because New Year's is coming up, but really what it means to people in different ways.

### [00:36:28] Stara Shakti

Okay.

### [00:36:28 - 00:36:48] Doug Snyder

it could be something as much as what allows you to declare victory or that this is done and do another stair step up. So it's not necessarily running away from something, but it could be, it could be all kinds of things. So within that, we're now in the section of sharing like, hey, this is what I did last week. This is what I learned. This is what I'm doing next week. Here's a challenge I had ahead of me, but kind of that chance to, you know, five, five, seven minutes to say what's happening with you and let us.

### [00:36:58 - 00:37:03] Stara Shakti

Thank you, Doug. Rick, were you going to say something too?

### [00:37:05] Rick Webster

I was wondering who might want to go next.

### [00:37:07] Stara Shakti

Oh, okay.

### [00:37:08] Rick Webster

Thank you.

### [00:37:09] Stara Shakti

I need a few minutes.

### [00:37:13 - 00:39:17] Julie Dorshkind

I can go next. Okay. So, last week I said I was going to sit down at my computer every day except Christmas and work on my resume and apply to half the jobs on my list. And I wrote this in the chat that I did the first part almost except for one day. So I sat down every day at my computer and did work, but I didn't do the second part, which was actually applied jobs because I didn't finish the resume. And so that was good that I, you know, did the first half and I felt like accountable to the group. And so that was pressure to get me to do it that I probably wouldn't, may not have done. As completely without the group, but I still didn't get to the second half, which is an issue, and I'm starting to get frustrated with how long I've been working on the resume and about to give up, but it's been my white whale that I just want to defeat, because I've been using AI to try to improve it, and I've been fighting with AI for a long time, and it's frustrating me, and now I feel like I'm just ready to give up, which is probably what I should have done months ago. But white whale means, like, it's this, you know, quest, this obsession to defeat it, that, you know, I don't want to give up on the idea of what I was chasing, and which was, like, using ChatGPT to go over all my old documents and stuff and come up with all these good insights and metrics and data, proof points to show on my resume resume. Because we're supposed to have outcome and impact-based bullets. I just saw someone in the chat ask about WAGO. So anyway, so going back, so I did the first half, didn't finish the second half, but I did feel the accountability from the group. So that was a positive for me in getting me to do more than I otherwise would have done.

### [00:39:26 - 00:39:31] Doug Snyder

So you set a goal and did it, right? Is that what I heard?

### [00:39:31 - 00:39:33] Julie Dorshkind

Everybody heard that, right? You did, but we found part A as done, except for one day, but that was just close enough.

### [00:39:40 - 00:40:13] Doug Snyder

So might be a perfect time for a new start, right? All right. Just like what Rick was saying, going up the mountain, but yet you've actually done, the sitting down and doing that is such a bigger deal than you could ever share anyplace else, really. Everybody is very much outcome, but I just want to settle for a moment in, in that thing where you I I'm going to do that hard thing, and I was thinking about the group, because I actually want to do this thing, and it shouldn't be so hard, but dang it, it is. And you come back and talk about it. That's...awesome.

### [00:40:16 - 00:40:31] Melissa Reskof

Well, being activated, right? The over-promise, right? We have this idea that we could do all the things, but being at your desk every day, except for the holiday, Wow! Yeah.

### [00:40:33] Julie Dorshkind

Not for a full day, just sitting down at all accounts, but I said I was to do it, and I did that part.

### [00:40:38 - 00:40:47] Doug Snyder

Yeah, yeah, you're a caveat, that's right. Oh, but there's all this other stuff, the context, to reinforce that I didn't actually do something. You did something! This thing here, you do that more often, that's how these quests become, you know, epic stories later on, right?

### [00:40:56] Julie Dorshkind

Yeah.

### [00:40:58 - 00:41:01] Doug Snyder

Well, it sounds super tough, actually. It's this next phase, right? I could see why it's so frustrating and why a tool should be able to help in this, and yet you're trying to, like, prove with statistics that you're good at statistics and it's worthwhile to talk statistics with you in some weird way.

### [00:41:16 - 00:41:17] Julie Dorshkind

Yeah, sort of. I mean, it's more I just want, I just want to, like, have all this time I was spending on it, not be in vain.

### [00:41:30 - 00:42:38] Rick Webster

Yeah, I kind of have a take on that, because we all have. We've all had lots of things that we consider failures in our life that didn't go right. But I think, especially if we want to get started climbing again, we've got to give ourselves credit for all the things we have done. I mean, we're still here, we're still alive, right? We have done some things that have worked in one way or another. And then another thing which sounds philosophical, but it's very real, is that... I don't believe that everything happens for a reason, I'm just not there, right, but I do believe that things that did happen that we might have really wished we didn't have to go through taught us things that we can now use in our present life. So even the failures, we've learned things from those things. So I think, I don't know, I think it's all useful. We tend to say, I wish I hadn't done this and that, and, you know, there might be some truth to it, I don't know. But the, the real fact is, we learned something from it, we can take forward. There is a point, I'm not going to go to the, there's a reason for everything, but there is a point in life where you get to and you say, well, I couldn't change any of those horrible things, or else some of good things that happened later would never have happened.

### [00:42:53 - 00:45:00] Lizzy Summers

I think we, we have so many gifts, because of the challenge. We have so many gifts for years We went through with other friends that was unseen. We developed a lot of invisible gifts that other, you know, that are very valuable. Okay, so I guess I'll go. One thing and I have this vision a lot. think of neurotypicals, they go on like these straight lines, like this. And we go, mmm, mmm, mmm, But we come back across. but in the end you know we have we're the beautiful flowers you know they're the stem you know I thought that would be a beautiful like um animation you know these people in straight lines but that's such an interesting analogy I've never heard that like beautiful designs and swirls and you know yeah so I guess for me well I'm gonna I'm committing and for me my friction is having a time I mean I've never had a nine-to-five job my whole life, so when I set time, but I didn't know I had this issue, and I was able to just skirt under the radar, and still for me, knowing, okay, I'm to go to the Body Devil tomorrow at 9.30, I already have anxiety, because I set multiple timers to make it to this meeting, there's just this fear I'm going to miss it, because I'm going to get involved in something, and then I'm to the rodeo, and I'm gone for five hours. in something, so I have a lot of anxiety, and that's my friction right now, and I'm okay with it, because what I read is you have to desensitize it, since I've never had to be somewhere at a certain time, or many times in a row, I haven't built up comfort with that yet, so I'm going to be okay, like I'm anxious now, knowing, my god, 9.30 in the morning, you know, that means like I get up, walk the You know, and that's new to me, a lot of people have had jobs, most everybody I know, so I'm going to just be loving with myself with this anxiety, no, I'll probably have it for a little while, but as I get my life organized so I'm up and the things I need to do in the morning are done by 930, it's going to be good and it's going to be a challenge, but I'm committing to at least doing it while we're in the mastermind, and my goal the is really to desensitize to the anxiety and get used to being somewhere at a certain time.

### [00:45:43] Rick Webster

So is the goal, Lizzy, to desensitize yourself to the anxiety, or to live yourself, live your life in a way that doesn't create that much anxiety?

### [00:45:52 - 00:46:54] Lizzy Summers

That would be good too, but life doesn't work like that. I want the structure, the body double, the body doubles at 930. So, in the morning, there's, you know, one every day, and then there's three in the afternoon. And I want to know I can do that. I want to trust my emotional body that if I need to be there, I'm going to get myself there, and I'm going to be together, like, mentally and emotionally. You know, I don't know. I need to do it. I need to know I can get myself somewhere on time if I need to be. You know, and anyway, and that's something I don't like about myself. I don't like that I'm just have all these skills, lack a lot of skills because I never had a real job or, you know, and I lived in a cult and, you know, just all these weird things about me. And I'm missing a lot of stuff that people just learn from just getting a job or, or having kids or, you know, something. And so.

### [00:46:55] Melissa Reskof

Did you go to high school or?

### [00:46:57 - 00:47:00] Lizzy Summers

I went to high school, and then I ran away. I at 15 in my 11th year and then was wild with a fake I.G.

### [00:47:06] Melissa Reskof

At some point, 15 and earlier, you had to get up, get yourself dressed, get to school, get to bus, something.

### [00:47:15 - 00:47:16] Lizzy Summers

You're right. I had that.

### [00:47:17 - 00:47:33] Melissa Reskof

Yeah. Yeah. We forget the things we did and have some skills in. Doug and I have a, we call it, we forget better. It's like, it's totally, I've never had to do that. Wait. There was this whole formative time in your life where you did.

### [00:47:36 - 00:47:44] Lizzy Summers

You're right. And that's helpful for me to think about that. Cause it's gotta be in my body, you know, getting up, go to school, getting up, go to school. You know, it's like lifetimes ago, you know, 50 years.

### [00:47:49 - 00:48:36] Doug Snyder

It's like whatever. Remember these things, you don't have to be an expert and, you know, super competent in that. It's, it's, it's a little scaffolding.oulding. So you can get on to the actually doing the things, right, which part of it is, hey, I'm going to show up in the time so I can show up on time, but what it's really to body double and work and do something that matters. Oh, okay. At first it's, you know, this running away, don't screw up. And at some point, like, oh, I want to be there because I want to be there and because something good happened. So, you know, just keep doing a little bit and look for those moments too. The attraction becomes stronger and the repulsion from the other becomes less and less and we remake this as a, oh, I can do those things. I wonder. Because you got a lot of alignment, you know, or like, wait a second, this composite of me, these things seem true.

### [00:48:43] Rick Webster

What if I ran with it?

### [00:48:45 - 00:49:15] Lizzy Summers

I wonder what you... I mean, you know, what both of y'all said combined, I think what I'm to do instead of saying, I'm going to go Monday through Friday at 930. I think I'll go some of the mornings, some of the afternoons, and then I don't have that anxiety, but I would like to... I to get myself together and ready to be, you know, and so thank you, Rick. think I'm do that instead of committing to every five mornings. I'm going to do maybe three mornings and the afternoons. I like that noon one is good. There's three noon ones, five 9.30 ones, and two seven.

### [00:49:20 - 00:49:35] Rick Webster

A slower start. Yeah, I think a slower start is probably better. That would be me. I can't help but wonder what you learned. I mean, if I ran away from home at 15, I would have starved to death in a week. I would not have been able to figure it out. So you did figure it out.

### [00:49:37 - 00:51:53] Lizzy Summers

I will tell you, you know, and I know I've got to write a book about this because it's freaking amazing. Like, I did pull up the chat, JP thing. So of my top five, four of them are transcendence. You said that work. And the one is wisdom. so, you know, I'm not. I, you know, it's a different path for me, and, um, anyway, anyway, I forgot where I was going for that, uh, yeah, I gotta get back into the meaning, it's not the doing and the numbers for me, what's gonna make my life tick is everything I do comes from that deep sense of purpose and meaning, and so, thanks Rick for reminding me that I feel bad already, like, things I already had that was just sitting getting in here, like, this buzz is gone, knowing, okay, I'm gonna loosen that up, maybe not, that's, maybe that's too much for me now, pick a few mornings, commit to the afternoons, that'd be easy, noon, for me, because I'm central time is perfect, and then a couple mornings to practice, you know, then the noons, and probably not the evenings, because then I got dinner and all that stuff, but I feel better already. Hey! I overcommitted myself and didn't even know it, so maybe now I know that's my gauge, but what I learned, I learned that I am cared for, there's definitely a benevolent being. The amount of just stuff I saw on the streets was horrible. I was never, ever harmed. It was like I always think of that movie where the Scrooge and he had the three angels. I mean, the situations I was in, I never felt alone. always felt the presence was with me. I never got hurt or damaged or scarred or diseases or anything, and I just felt like I was shown this, and then I landed in a cult for 20 years, which, yeah, there's a lot of negative stuff, but the positive stuff was I traveled the world. I mean, I've been to so many countries. We were all photographers and filmmakers, and we made documentary films, and we traveled the world.

### [00:51:58] Rick Webster

and we studied the the the

### [00:52:04 - 00:52:22] Lizzy Summers

So I learned, though, too, I think it's important if you're in a dysfunctional family, you need to have a pattern interrupt. I think it was the best thing for me to run away because my brothers didn't, and both of them are kind of stuck in the mental patterns of the family. They weren't able to break free and just create a new trajectory for them, and I'm so grateful.

### [00:52:30] Doug Snyder

A new start.

### [00:52:31] Lizzy Summers

Yeah.

### [00:52:32 - 00:52:44] Doug Snyder

A new start. A I'm looking at the time, and I want to make sure everybody gets a chance to jump in and share. Yep. So, who would like to talk about it? Jasmine? Stara?

### [00:52:47] Jasmine Mahmoud

I can go.

### [00:52:48] Rick Webster

Yep.

### [00:52:49 - 00:55:01] Jasmine Mahmoud

Okay. So, last week, I don't know if I actually verbally said it out loud, but I committed to making three videos. I've so far I shot two out of the three, and what I learned about myself during the process is I like writing the scripts. I don't love being on camera. I don't hate it. I don't love it. I'm kind of neutral, but I kind of hate the editing process. It's a little bit tedious. Would love to have the ability to outsource that in the future or even clone myself. That's why I've been watching like Julie McCoy's videos. But anyway, something that I wanted to run past the group if they're okay with it. So I kind of like have these creative bursts that happen kind of spontaneously. And that's why it's kind of great to have my phone on me because then I can just voice note into chat and GBT. And so one of the things that I had been thinking about is how does my brain work, right? Like, I'm very good at... I have the tendency to over-model future possibilities and outcomes, and I discovered that it's kind of a double-edged sword, because on the one hand, it makes me a formidable chess player, but on the other hand, it's like, why do I wake up every day in this spiral where I'm trying to solve every possible future in order to prevent harm? And what I mean by that is, some people might call it rumination, right? What could go wrong today? What should I prioritize? What if I choose wrong? So I recently shared with Rick that I just thought of a question, and I think it works, and I'm not sure why it works, which is that interrupts that spiral, which is what would make today successful. So if it's okay to share my screen. I actually put something together. Let me see. You do. You You ... Thank you. I'm trying to share.

### [00:55:06] Melissa Reskof

Do you need permission to share?

### [00:55:08] Jasmine Mahmoud

I think so.

### [00:55:09 - 00:55:19] Melissa Reskof

Okay. I'm going to make you co-host because that's a shortcut for me to do it. Did that work?

### [00:55:24] Jasmine Mahmoud

No, I still don't.

### [00:55:26] Melissa Reskof

Oh, yeah, I see it now. Share.

### [00:55:27] Rick Webster

And we'll fix that by next week.

### [00:55:32 - 00:55:33] Jasmine Mahmoud

Well, clicking on share. Why is it not working?

### [00:55:36] Rick Webster

Do you have to click a screen?

### [00:55:39] Jasmine Mahmoud

No, like I'm clicking on the button and it's share.

### [00:55:50] Julie Dorshkind

Like the Google Doc or anything, you could...

### [00:55:53] Jasmine Mahmoud

Oh, yeah.

### [00:55:56] Julie Dorshkind

No, you're sharing.

### [00:55:58 - 00:59:29] Jasmine Mahmoud

Okay, you guys see my screen? No, Okay, this is why I think it works. It's the question that turns stuck into action. Okay, so I was trying to describe to him kind of like, I'm like listening to everyone, but I'm also trying to understand like, what is really happening? What is the underlying sentiment of what's happening when we get stuck in this endless thought rumination? So I think that this is what it is. It's emotion. And then we tell ourselves a story about that emotion. And then we judge ourselves, and then we end up being stuck. And so the reason why we keep looping every time we try to push ourselves to commit to an action is because that feeling demands an explanation. That explanation turns into a verdict about you, and then that verdict makes starting feel unsafe. And so I thought about how somebody mentioned in the group, I don't know if it was last week or the week before, that they are kind of tired of these, you know, generic product. And so I was thinking to myself, why doesn't that work? And I'm like, well, maybe it's because we don't need generic productivity hacks. We actually need nervous system interventions. And so I think if I had to take a stab at it, by the way, Rick, thought about this question a ton more after our call yesterday. If I had to take a stab at it, my guess would be that this question more or less functions like a nervous system intervention. So when your intent and output, when they don't align, action itself becomes emotionally charged. So task initiation carries shame, fear, and memory. So it's kind of like, so think about the last time that you attempted a task, and then you reflected on it afterwards, like, why didn't you start it? Is it because you're anxious because, oh, if I can't do it, this proves that I'm incompetent? Or... Or if I do it, then maybe people will judge me. Or some people may not want to commit, right, because they think it's irreversible. And then some people are just feeling like this sense of past pain, like last time I tried, I got criticized, right? So that's what I think it is. think eventually it gets to a point where a task initiation carries shame, fear and memory. So like, I think the reason why generic productivity advice doesn't work is because we're solving for the wrong problem. So if someone says, like, you're lazy, that implies that you don't care and that you have low motivation. But if we're saying that task initiation carries shame, fear and memory, then that means that that's a conditioned threat response, right? That's a nervous system state. That's you saying to yourself, I care, but starting feel. So my system is just going to hit the brakes on that. So I decided I was going to redefine the problem. So instead of like how do I get motivated, how do I rebuild trust with action? So this is what I showed Rick yesterday. And I said, I think it's really been working for me. I've got this acrylic board on my refrigerator, and I literally wrote the question down, which is, what would make today successful? So on the left side, I noticed that I get into these...

### [00:59:35] Rick Webster

It's pretty small, Jasmine.

### [00:59:37] Jasmine Mahmoud

Oh, sorry.

### [00:59:37] Rick Webster

you post the thumbnails on the side?

### [00:59:39] Stara Shakti

It's very blurry.

### [00:59:41] Jasmine Mahmoud

Oh, it's blurry?

### [00:59:42] Rick Webster

Well, I think it'll be better when it gets bigger.

### [00:59:46] Jasmine Mahmoud

I did. I made it full screen.

### [00:59:48] Rick Webster

Can you guys see it now?

### [00:59:49] Melissa Reskof

It's still loading.

### [00:59:50] Stara Shakti

I don't see anything now.

### [00:59:51 - 00:59:52] Rick Webster

just says loading. Yeah, it's loading.

### [00:59:56 - 00:59:57] Melissa Reskof

Unshare and then reshare. It'll come back better.

### [00:59:58 - 01:00:00] Stara Shakti

Rachel. Thank you. Great idea.

### [01:00:01] Jasmine Mahmoud

Okay.

### [01:00:02] Melissa Reskof

Looks good now.

### [01:00:03] Stara Shakti

Melissa, you're the best.

### [01:00:05] Doug Snyder

good.

### [01:00:06 - 01:04:20] Jasmine Mahmoud

Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Sorry. So on the left side, I put all of our mental... This is kind of the mental loops that I'm seeing myself getting stuck in, which is my brain keeps running these scenarios. I'm trying to understand cause and effect. I'm trying to avoid mistakes, but the thinking never finishes. And then oftentimes I also find myself getting stuck before starting. So nothing feels rewarding yet. Starting feels harder than thinking. These intense emotions... Oh, wait. Why did it? Skip. These intense emotions have this tendency to grab my attention and I stay stuck in my head. Right? So why this question, why I think it works is it limits the overthinking. It creates a tangible stopping point and it defines like what's enough for And then on the right side, I have what this question actually does. So it shrinks the day. You don't have to solve your whole life. What's good enough just for today? It creates direction, so you choose what matters today. And then distractions become easier to spot. And when I say that, I mean that this isn't just a question that interrupts the thought rumination in the morning. This is a question that you can continue to refer back to during the day. So hopefully distractions become easier to spot. And you can now course correct without guilt. And it also makes your progress feel real. So small wins count, completion beats perfection, and then momentum comes from clarity. Oh, wait. And then I kind of made this one shortly before the meeting. So remember the emotional loop that I discussed in the beginning. I'll one. I I'm Thank Emotion turns into a story, right, why is this happening, that becomes self-judgment, what it says about me, and then you become stuck, but if we interrupt it with what would make today successful, now we're rerouting it into a plan, so what this question I think unintentionally does is it forces a little bit of introspection, and it asks us, it reminds me to ask myself, how much energy do I have right now? Let's also I'm forced to look at my constraints, which is my time and my resources., It forces me to define success as a realistic small one. Then I take an action, and then that creates momentum Okay. So a good Daily Success question is small enough to start, clear enough to know when it's done, and then meaningful enough to count. And for ADHD, it... creates a clear wind condition, it allows for fast closure, and also gives you the micro successes that are emotionally legible. And then what I also told Rick was, I find that when I answer this question, more often times than not, what I'm listing kind of falls into one of these three categories, which is, like, what are all the meaningful actions that we take every single day? So the first being maintain the present. So this is the stuff that keeps your life from sliding backward. Or what are the things that we're doing in our day-to-day life to prevent those future fires from occurring? So under this box, I put home and daily logistics, health basics, admin that prevents problems. These things tend to keep you stable. And then the second box, which is what I think we're all really focused on in here, is investing in the future. That's learning and skill building, creating or writing long-term projects, career steps, and then the last, which is to restore and regulate. That protects your capacity to keep going. So these are the things that actually keep you feeling fulfilled and human, rest and recovery, movement and joy, connection and come. And that's all I have for you guys today.

### [01:04:24] Julie Dorshkind

This is amazing.

### [01:04:26] Jasmine Mahmoud

That's all?

### [01:04:27 - 01:04:31] Julie Dorshkind

Are you kidding me? It's both the content and the design. Like, I can't, like, for me to do a presentation like this, like, it would take me forever and it's an amazing skill.

### [01:04:40 - 01:04:44] Stara Shakti

Yeah, same, same. Um, so much amazing information there. And, um, I definitely want to, like, yeah, like print it out and, like, look at it often because you've really nailed so much of, like, what is in my brain and I'm sure a lot of other people here too, but um,

### [01:05:00] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah, I could send it to you.

### [01:05:02] Stara Shakti

I'll send it to you.

### [01:05:03] Jasmine Mahmoud

I'll it to everybody.

### [01:05:04 - 01:05:09] Stara Shakti

Yeah, send it to everybody. And yeah, it's very deep. It's very deep. You've put a lot of thought into this, and it definitely shows.

### [01:05:12 - 01:05:13] Jasmine Mahmoud

It's so helpful. Thank you.

### [01:05:14 - 01:05:27] Stara Shakti

Ridiculously helpful. Yeah. Okay, thank you so much for that feedback, because now you've given me the vote of confidence to actually turn this into content because... Yeah, you should. Absolutely.

### [01:05:27] Jasmine Mahmoud

Ridicely?

### [01:05:28 - 01:05:29] Stara Shakti

This is amazing content. you kidding me?

### [01:05:32] Julie Dorshkind

I mean, you're trying to do a career pivot, and this is amazing, I just said that word many times, work, where you have a really strong set of skills and you should be utilizing them.

### [01:05:49 - 01:05:50] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah. Yeah.

### [01:05:50] Stara Shakti

A lot of people don't know how to do this.

### [01:05:53 - 01:05:58] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah. You know, so my therapist was explaining this to me, and I didn't quite understand it when he said it. He said, you have a system.

### [01:05:59 - 01:06:09] Stara Shakti

matrix doing What And I didn't know what that was, and it's kind of like, I didn't know this about myself, I thought everybody thought this way. I wouldn't call it a bias, I don't know why he said that, but I would call it systemizing, like, brain.

### [01:06:14] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah.

### [01:06:15] Stara Shakti

I don't know.

### [01:06:16 - 01:06:28] Jasmine Mahmoud

But anyway, so I told him, like, what I do is I try to listen, and I try to understand, like, what is the invisible logic that is happening behind the words that someone is saying. And then I turn it into a problem, and then I try to solve it.

### [01:06:35] Stara Shakti

I agree with Melissa, this could be a TED talk.

### [01:06:38] Jasmine Mahmoud

Like, this is so amazing.

### [01:06:40 - 01:06:48] Julie Dorshkind

When I go back also, like, there's both the content and just the design aspect. You know, the visual nature. Yeah. Did you use anything to create this?

### [01:06:52] Jasmine Mahmoud

ChatGBT, and it took me, like, 45 minutes.

### [01:06:54] Stara Shakti

Really?

### [01:06:54] Julie Dorshkind

ChatGBT.

### [01:06:55] Stara Shakti

Oh, my God!

### [01:06:57 - 01:06:58] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah. Yeah.

### [01:06:58] Stara Shakti

It's wonderful!

### [01:07:00 - 01:07:06] Julie Dorshkind

So, yeah, I need to, I've never used it to create presentations, that's... No.

### [01:07:06 - 01:07:30] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah, you know what you could do? You could actually just go on YouTube, and I'm sure there is, I learned it kind of intuitively, because people laugh at me, but I think the AI thinks a little bit like me, like this input output, input output, so I learned it rather intuitively, but I know you can go on YouTube and you can just look up prompt engineering, and then that way, like, I, it's not, it's not hard, I promise. So look up prompt engineering tutorials, and then just listen to a few tutorials, and then you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna love yourself for it.

### [01:07:39] Julie Dorshkind

Just do it. I just didn't know anything made, um, presentations, like, or made them, I knew there was a little, but I thought it didn't make it successfully, and...

### [01:07:47] Jasmine Mahmoud

Oh, it does more than you think it can do.

### [01:07:51] Rick Webster

A lot more.

### [01:07:51 - 01:07:53] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah. Okay, I'm done.

### [01:07:55 - 01:07:56] Doug Snyder

No, you're not. I got questions for you.

### [01:07:57] Jasmine Mahmoud

Oh, okay.

### [01:07:59 - 01:09:08] Doug Snyder

So... So, I first want to just bask in what kind of impact you made on people, right, that you said, hey, can I do this? It was in your swim lane. I can only imagine what it helps cement as you were saying it, right? It's like a form of verbal processing that is really cementing in because you're declaring in front of people. Super cool. So the big question is, all right, what part are you using? How can you use it? How does this next inform you? And it's not for today in this section because you just did this. I don't want that answer, but like, oh, go practice and come back and say, you know, the thing I said that I thought was important, I tried it. really was important to me because of this. I'd love to hear that kind of, I made a mental framework a little bit about who I am and how I kind of operate. Now, how can I use it to navigate this next thing? Where does it fit into it? I'd love to hear that story. you. Because this is the beginning of a really rich personal operating manual. If this is not in place, this is what happens.

### [01:09:12 - 01:09:18] Jasmine Mahmoud

Actually, I thought of a lot about what you said during the first week of our Mastermind. So I thought of another iteration of this question, which is, given my capacity today, what does success look like?

### [01:09:26] Doug Snyder

Oh, now you're getting into a place that actually...

### [01:09:31] Stara Shakti

That's good one.

### [01:09:31 - 01:10:09] Doug Snyder

Really good. Yep. And it's really hard for us to ask that question, right? You have to, at some point, go, wait a second, what is the next question? We're always solving these proximity problems, one that's closest to us. Instead of like, oh, you know, if I solve three away from here, I actually get all of them done. And that one, I can do a new start in something different instead of trying to slay this one right in front of me. And it's like, I'll just jump right over you and you get pulled into the next thing. Yeah. So... Yeah, try it on, try that on, and love to hear what you learned by going, yeah, I refined, I tried it, helped me. Oh, it helped me pause here or speed up there.

### [01:10:12 - 01:10:25] Jasmine Mahmoud

I don't know, I'm fascinated by that. Yeah, it trains you. So I think another reason why this question works is because it trains you to be a dynamic problem solver. I think that's what I'm hearing there. That's what you're saying, right? Well, I want to see now.

### [01:10:28 - 01:10:32] Doug Snyder

How does it work for you now? I want you to go, take your framework. Oh my God, I can't wait to study this.

### [01:10:34] Jasmine Mahmoud

I mean, literally.

### [01:10:36 - 01:10:54] Doug Snyder

Everybody's very excited to go, I want to hear you say, I used my framework and learned something here. Because everybody was really engaged in how you presented it. Add context, the value, proof, show your work. You know, this framework works for me, but you know what? There's a new little nuance I added.

### [01:10:55] Jasmine Mahmoud

Oh, I learned this thing about myself.

### [01:10:57 - 01:11:00] Doug Snyder

That's... That's... You Amazing.

### [01:11:02] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah, thank you.

### [01:11:07] Doug Snyder

Okay, check.

### [01:11:09] Lizzy Summers

back just for real quick.

### [01:11:11 - 01:11:16] Doug Snyder

Yeah, just time check. like to share before we end. Yeah, let's jump into that and then we can circle back with the good vibes because, you know, that was cool, Jasmine.

### [01:11:22 - 01:11:47] Lizzy Summers

Let's let Lizzy finish her comment she started. Okay. was going to say, also, I heard a thing, instead of the to-do list, I like what she used. Also, how, how can I do this today? And someone told me that. Instead of just saying what you need to do, it's the steps, the invisible steps, which I stumble over. So, how can I do this? And asking myself that, I'll go, I'll need to do this part, and then I'll need to do this. And then it opens up the invisible to the visible.

### [01:11:54 - 01:13:00] Julie Dorshkind

For me, I found the question, like, what would make it today? bit. Thank And the kind of talking through it really helpful because when I have plans and they get off, I kind of abandon them and don't make any progress on anything. And so the idea that you can say that multiple times a day, and it's different circumstances, and yes, everything's gone wrong and you haven't done whatever you need to do as you ask that question later in the day. You know, you take into account that you have different circumstances. So what makes it success can change over the course of today. Like I have all of these plans and I think bigger, you know, earlier in the day and what would make it success is like much higher of a, you know, a hurdle to climb versus like later in the day where I'm like, just do that one small tiny thing. Just take out the garbage that makes success success. Versus like, so I. I think it came to life for me and in a way that I think could be really helpful if I just keep centered back to that at different times in the day.

### [01:13:09 - 01:14:24] Jasmine Mahmoud

Yeah, because when I practiced it the first two days, I was like, oh, this feels different because it's smaller. It feels safer. It's more defined because, you know, when we have this, you know, at least me, I have this tendency to overmodel like cause and effect. I have this tendency to, so to me, it's not just about, how should I say it? So I think there's two sides of my brain that I'm constantly toggling back and forth. Lizzy, I'm sure you could relate. So there is the, there's the autistic side, which really is looking for like closure and is trying to resolve discrepancies. And then there's the ADHD side, which is all about stimulation and reward timing. something. Theunyaças the u-use egg. next So when, so it's all about taking those micro actions, I find, because those, we're thinking about those big rewards, but we're not necessarily, we should be focusing more on those tasks that give those immediate feedback, because those little micro actions, that's what produces that fast dopamine. So I think, yeah, I'm really glad that you got a lot of value out of it. Yeah.

### [01:14:31] Doug Snyder

Stara, give you a chance to get caught up with you.

### [01:14:36 - 01:20:00] Stara Shakti

Yeah. Thank you. Um, I've had kind of a rough week, and, um, I did get some things done, but, um, there was some, like, family of choice, um, drama. And not drama, um, just dynamics, and, uh. Okay. So that kind of pulled me away from my everything. I mean, I did some things, but I also didn't do a lot of things, and I'm feeling a little emotionally overwhelmed right now because of having to take charge of a situation to help my partner that really isn't my situation to be, you know, taking charge of, but somebody had to do it. And she's feeling overwhelmed, related to caregiving for her mother and, you know, who's aging, and I had to do some, like, some dynamics shifting over there. So anyway, I'm, like, a little discombobulated. I broke the nose, both of my glasses, my prescription sunglasses on me. And, um, discombobulated. Thank Thank Thank think that Christmas holiday just kind of took me out of, I feel unfocused, I feel like I gotta refocus and recommit to, like, work right now, and I just feel a little, like, a little further. I'm being pulled in different directions and, um, . Okay, sorry. So, um, I did set up meeting with Melissa Melissa, right after this at 2.30, and, um, you were gonna talk about conversations with Melissa, and, uh, that, you know, hopefully will help, you know, me promote the decolonizing therapy group. And, um, I, I just now finished going through all the email recaps of the past few weeks meetings. I don't know why, I just, um, I'm trying to get used to a new VA, you know, who started last week, but is sick this week. They're not doing work, right? What am I supposed to do here? So I'm still doing client scheduling anyway, and seeing clients, and so I want to revisit that concept that Melissa said about the live enrollment parties, so maybe we could talk about it and it'll help get it back into my brain. I'm like, oh yeah, I forgot about that idea. That's a great idea, and I remember being so excited. Family drama can sometimes pull you out of yourself, and I think I just got pulled out a little bit too much. So I just finished sketching up on those emails. I wanted to follow up with Bernice about some of our kind of common work and cross-promoting the group and also JoJo about voice singing stuff and imposter syndrome. I didn't do either of those. So I would need to add that to my... I just added it to my... to my... to my... my... But I have been posting the graphic and I need to send some direct emails to a couple of people who have access to groups that would be really interested in that. And one of them is Kiana. People I know from the Diversity Committee from my local therapist group, and it's a lot of therapist followers in her group. So anyway, I need to post it on the Business School for Therapists because that's also a very big community of thousands of therapists. I'm a neurodiverse therapist support group facilitator that I created for therapists. And people know me there, you know. So I've got to tell people what I'm doing. What I'm struggling with is, besides getting pulled out, you know, from myself and my work, the family stuff, to be is I to this, don't struggling with is... Well, staying focused too. That's a problem. What was I going to say? Oh, yeah. There's still a part of me that's just... I'm just very emotional right now. A part of me that's still afraid to put myself out there. And it's just been a stressful week, so... I don't want to hold back. I want a new beginning, a new year, where I'm not holding back. I'm not holding myself back from shining as fully as I can and sharing my gifts from people. It's been a big, long-standing issue, and... I just... I don't want to hold myself back anymore. I want to share myself fully, and... I so much to share. I need you. And I don't Oh, I have to end on a downer note, but, um, yeah, it's, well, can I jump in there?

### [01:20:10 - 01:21:00] Doug Snyder

Downer note, you, you just verbally expressed many things that we're going through, and really what that overwhelm feels like, and what a powerful reminder of, yeah, it's a real thing, and then we beat ourselves up about it, and you'd be able to share that, is, uh, this is, this is what it looks like, this is what overwhelm looks like, and, and it happens all the time to us, and this, this, the Stara that I imagined, if we were both going to go talk to her, whoever she is over there, she'd probably go, oh, dude, your, your, your nervous system whacked out, you need to do a reset, right? And so I'm kind of like hearing your voice going, yeah, this thing here, this is, this is what to do. T-T-T-T They go, yeah, it's just a real thing, and big breath.

### [01:21:06] Stara Shakti

Yeah.

### [01:21:07] Doug Snyder

I can't imagine all the times that Melissa's seen me where I've been overwhelmed and been feeling those emotions and not able to have access to them except lashing out.

### [01:21:18] Stara Shakti

Yeah.

### [01:21:19 - 01:21:32] Doug Snyder

And this, you're trying to make sense of right in the middle of it, you know, the struggle with, no, no, I'm supposed to be doing this here thing here, but I have these feels right now because this is what overwhelms How do you pause out of that? Because you don't feel like you can, which is really Jasmine's safety message.

### [01:21:37 - 01:21:49] Stara Shakti

I know. That's why it resonated so much with me. Wow. Oh. Anyway. She's feeding me really kind of down and dirty right now, like all raw and exposed. But sometimes this happens, you know?

### [01:21:53 - 01:21:54] Doug Snyder

Yeah. Not sometimes.

### [01:21:54 - 01:21:56] Stara Shakti

It will. It happens.

### [01:21:57] Doug Snyder

Yeah. Yeah. you.

### [01:22:00 - 01:23:09] Stara Shakti

So, I think a lot of my overwhelm is letting other people take my attention, and the new me is focused on myself. It starts the day with priorities. I want to follow, Jasmine, your thing. I think it's amazing. I want to have a few small achievable goals for my day, for every day, based on my capacity, and that goes up and down, as you all know. So, um, yeah, I want to have, um, realistic goals. I want to, um, I want to not hold myself back from anybody, from everybody, and definitely not from myself. Just a bit time be people Consult's I do it a lot less than I used to, but I am still doing it. And I just need to be real about that right now.

### [01:23:13 - 01:23:55] Doug Snyder

Yeah. There's a strange mindset thing going on, right? You know, this thing that, you know, versus body set. I'm always thinking in the head, but I'm like, oh, you're really bringing that, I'm not in touch with all the rest of things, and yet they are a driver. This alignment of, like, what's really happening, can I even acknowledge it? And this holding back is, I don't trust myself, I might do that thing again instead of the other possibilities. Or guess what, we're going to do that thing again, and everybody still likes us? Right? I mean, you know, I feel like I could get tossed off the island, but, you know, I still like you. Oh, you mean I can really be mean? I'm not going to... Wow, that sounds like safety. And if somebody would get a good infographic about that, I don't who, but some amazing...

### [01:24:02 - 01:24:36] Stara Shakti

Yeah, and it is about safety, and I don't remember if I mentioned this, but for me, a lot of this is like family of origins, unsafety, whatever, and also my past life, unsafety as a witch who was burned at the stake, and that's a lot of what holds me back, and I know it's not that time, and I know it's like, I'm fine, can share whatever, you know, and people will love it. Like, there's so many people who love me all across the world, you know? But, they're still that nervousness.

### [01:24:40] Doug Snyder

Did you just hear, did anybody just hear that?

### [01:24:42] Stara Shakti

Risa, yeah.

### [01:24:44 - 01:24:55] Doug Snyder

That was freaking cool. No, you said, people love me all over the world. Yeah. This authentically, this was a value that you were sharing. Like, this is like a fact.

### [01:24:56] Stara Shakti

Yeah.

### [01:24:57 - 01:25:00] Doug Snyder

I don't, that's a... It's stunning to hear, and what we all desire is something like that, and you could confidently say, I create relationships like this.

### [01:25:08] Stara Shakti

Yeah.

### [01:25:09] Doug Snyder

That's frickin' amazing.

### [01:25:11 - 01:27:42] Stara Shakti

Yeah. And I thank you, and I think I've definitely been having the big breakthrough recently that my life is relationships. And my business, my new business, it has to be based on collaboration with people, with working with other people and doing things together. And that's how I'm going to, I think, finally create wealth. Like, I don't, I'm not, I'm not doing this myself anymore. I'm not. I got a business coach. I got, I started Team Shock 2 Fire Rising. Like, a team. I think that happened this week, too. Oh, God, that's a really great thing, actually. And I got, like, Susie, who did the song circle, goddess chant song circle with me. She's like. We were supposed to meet last night, but she had to reschedule. That's another thing I tried to do, but anyway, yeah. So she's going to be like that team member with that focus, and then I've got the business coach. And actually, I think I may have mentioned, I'm thinking about also offering one of the other things that's coming through. I want to offer some kind of like anger, rage, release, dance parties kind of thing where people can get really angry and like, you know, shake it out loud and, you know, anyway, blah, blah, blah. I have a friend, a really good long-term friend. I bet we've been friends for probably, I don't know, 10, 15 years. And she used to be a DJ. And she made me a track. I asked for 15 to 20 minutes. She made me a track for like four hours on Spotify. And she was like, just take what you want. It's all music to get in touch with and release anger. And Rage. I have to listen to it now. I've been starting to listen to it, and I didn't figure out what I'm going to do, but I think, I think that's, yeah, she's going to be now like my, you know, musical kind of coordinator or something, because she's just got so much, she's got so much music up there that she can access than me. So, just did it like that. So, this is what I mean. I've got people everywhere who are willing to help me. I just need to feel safe enough to be seen, to put myself out there to ask for help, and then to really receive. That's my goal right now.

### [01:27:44 - 01:27:51] Doug Snyder

As a systems thinker, that seems like a really sound first principle, right? You know, when in doubt, just keep doing that thing.

### [01:27:54] Stara Shakti

Yeah.

### [01:27:55 - 01:28:23] Doug Snyder

It will pay off, right? mean, there's a bunch of things underneath there, but it's really that. for I I mean, keep... If doing this with people, something will come out of this, so keep doing that. I love that. I'm looking at the time, and we're right at the bottom of the hour, and Rick, what do you think? Something in the next couple of days is happening, and people make a little big thing out of it, and yet we're going to start something next week. And we could say we're into the new year, and what some of your thoughts on what you're thinking?

### [01:28:30 - 01:28:53] Rick Webster

Well, think we're learning a lot, and I really heard some really good sharing here, and I think that's part of this. It is fear-inducing, right? Pull off whatever mask we're wearing and come out behind it and trust that we can be vulnerable with the right people in the right situation. And we truly believe we have most of answers we need inside of our own head. It's just really hard to get to them without processing with other people in some ways.

### [01:28:57 - 01:28:58] Stara Shakti

Yes. Yes.

### [01:29:02 - 01:29:16] Rick Webster

And I think fear does hold us back a lot. When I feel myself being held back that way, which is fairly often, actually, I gotta ask myself, what am I really afraid of, right? What's going to happen? What would be the worst case scenario here? And if I can't handle that, and maybe I have to consider sharing with someone different, some different people that I can find people that I can trust, to be honest with.

### [01:29:25 - 01:29:51] Stara Shakti

Can I add one thing to that real quick, Rick, before we end? I also feel like, for me, I've found that anticipating the worst case scenario, yes, but also the best case scenario. And to me, for me, that helps me really, like, get out of myself and just move forward and do it anyway. Like, well, that could happen, or this could happen, you know? So I try to, like, try to focus on that, forward movement.

### [01:29:55 - 01:30:23] Rick Webster

I hear you on that, sure. Yeah. But I do tend to look at what's the worst case Because that's probably not going to slow me down, but if I may change your direction, but if I think what's the best case, I almost feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment, because the best case isn't going to happen most of the time. There's going to be some version of that. So I do want to have a vision for where I want to get to, but I, for some of these things, I kind of leave it open and say, I can't predict that stuff. If I could have, if it was that predictable, I would have done it a long time ago.

### [01:30:27] Stara Shakti

It's so funny how our different brains work.

### [01:30:30 - 01:30:47] Doug Snyder

Well, I'd like to make this a little Texas two-step here, right? You know, Rick's first question, hey, what's really afraid here? And what I'm hearing, Stara, is, hey, what's the opportunity? So it's, what am I running away from? And, oh yeah, the second side of that question, what am I running towards? I kind of hear that.

### [01:30:48] Stara Shakti

And Rick, can totally hear this over-promising.

### [01:30:52 - 01:31:22] Doug Snyder

So that, there's a, you know, kind of a boundary of what opportunity looks like, but it's like, oh, it's compelling. Something good will happen out of it. It could be A, B, or C, but all of them are an improvement, and I can build upon it. Versus, oh, if I just hit that home run, I really dreamed that thing, and it doesn't happen, and then I'm like, oh, good, I'm a failure again, and back to this negative thing. So I just love how you guys both talked about it and landed in a place for framework for me and go, oh, that works for me. My little thing, my operating manuals are going, that works for me.

### [01:31:25] Stara Shakti

Yeah.

### [01:31:26 - 01:31:29] Doug Snyder

Bursera, mindset, and then, wait, what about this mindset? Oh, okay.

### [01:31:31 - 01:31:39] Stara Shakti

Yeah. I put them both in the chat, and I feel like, obviously, life is usually somewhere in the middle. It's not either or or usually. It's, you know, that face of grace. But I'm excited to talk to Melissa after this.

### [01:31:42] Doug Snyder

Well, I'm going to let you guys go into it.

### [01:31:45] Stara Shakti

out of it.

### [01:31:46 - 01:31:55] Doug Snyder

And just the emotional rollercoaster, which having to share those things actually, what, freed up so you can actually talk about the next thing instead of carrying that other stuff. Yeah.

### [01:31:56 - 01:31:57] Stara Shakti

kind of new start. Yeah.

### [01:31:58 - 01:31:59] Doug Snyder

A different kind of new start. Necessary.

### [01:32:10 - 01:32:13] Gio

### [01:32:17 - 01:32:23] Doug Snyder

It sounded... Stop apologizing. We're glad to see you. You're all right. You're here. Woohoo! Gio's here. Sorry we couldn't get more of you.

### [01:32:25 - 01:32:38] Gio
